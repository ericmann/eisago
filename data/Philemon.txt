Philemon||1||1||Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker,
Philemon||1||2||and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the church in thy house:
Philemon||1||3||Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Philemon||1||4||I thank my God always, making mention of thee in my prayers,
Philemon||1||5||hearing of thy love, and of the faith which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;
Philemon||1||6||that the fellowship of thy faith may become effectual, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in you, unto Christ.
Philemon||1||7||For I had much joy and comfort in thy love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through thee, brother.
Philemon||1||8||Wherefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to enjoin thee that which is befitting,
Philemon||1||9||yet for loves sake I rather beseech, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus:
Philemon||1||10||I beseech thee for my child, whom I have begotten in my bonds, Onesimus,
Philemon||1||11||who once was unprofitable to thee, but now is profitable to thee and to me:
Philemon||1||12||whom I have sent back to thee in his own person, that is, my very heart:
Philemon||1||13||whom I would fain have kept with me, that in thy behalf he might minister unto me in the bonds of the gospel:
Philemon||1||14||but without thy mind I would do nothing; that thy goodness should not be as of necessity, but of free will.
Philemon||1||15||For perhaps he was therefore parted from thee for a season, that thou shouldest have him for ever;
Philemon||1||16||no longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much rather to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
Philemon||1||17||If then thou countest me a partner, receive him as myself.
Philemon||1||18||But if he hath wronged the at all, or oweth thee aught, put that to mine account;
Philemon||1||19||I Paul write it with mine own hand, I will repay it: that I say not unto thee that thou owest to me even thine own self besides.
Philemon||1||20||Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my heart in Christ.
Philemon||1||21||Having confidence in thine obedience I write unto thee, knowing that thou wilt do even beyond what I say.
Philemon||1||22||But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted unto you.
Philemon||1||23||Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus, saluteth thee;
Philemon||1||24||and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-workers.
Philemon||1||25||The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
