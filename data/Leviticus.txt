Leviticus||1||1||And Jehovah called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tent of meeting, saying,
Leviticus||1||2||Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man of you offereth an oblation unto Jehovah, ye shall offer your oblation of the cattle, even of the herd and of the flock.
Leviticus||1||3||If his oblation be a burnt-offering of the herd, he shall offer it a male without blemish: he shall offer it at the door of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before Jehovah.
Leviticus||1||4||And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the burnt-offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.
Leviticus||1||5||And he shall kill the bullock before Jehovah: and Aarons sons, the priests, shall present the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is at the door of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus||1||6||And he shall flay the burnt-offering, and cut it into its pieces.
Leviticus||1||7||And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay wood in order upon the fire;
Leviticus||1||8||and Aarons sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:
Leviticus||1||9||but its inwards and its legs shall he wash with water: and the priest shall burn the whole on the altar, for a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Leviticus||1||10||And if his oblation be of the flock, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt-offering; he shall offer it a male without blemish.
Leviticus||1||11||And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before Jehovah: and Aarons sons, the priests, shall sprinkle its blood upon the altar round about.
Leviticus||1||12||And he shall cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat; and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:
Leviticus||1||13||but the inwards and the legs shall he wash with water; and the priest shall offer the whole, and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Leviticus||1||14||And if his oblation to Jehovah be a burnt-offering of birds, then he shall offer his oblation of turtle-doves, or of young pigeons.
Leviticus||1||15||And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off its head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be drained out on the side of the altar;
Leviticus||1||16||and he shall take away its crop with the filth thereof, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, in the place of the ashes:
Leviticus||1||17||and he shall rend it by the wings thereof, but shall not divide it asunder; and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt-offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Leviticus||2||1||And when any one offereth an oblation of a meal-offering unto Jehovah, his oblation shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon:
Leviticus||2||2||and he shall bring it to Aarons sons the priests; and he shall take thereout his handful of the fine flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn it as the memorial thereof upon the altar, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah:
Leviticus||2||3||and that which is left of the meal-offering shall be Aarons and his sons: it is a thing most holy of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire.
Leviticus||2||4||And when thou offerest an oblation of a meal-offering baken in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.
Leviticus||2||5||And if thy oblation be a meal-offering of the baking-pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.
Leviticus||2||6||Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meal-offering.
Leviticus||2||7||And if thy oblation be a meal-offering of the frying-pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.
Leviticus||2||8||And thou shalt bring the meal-offering that is made of these things unto Jehovah: and it shall be presented unto the priest, and he shall bring it unto the altar.
Leviticus||2||9||And the priest shall take up from the meal-offering the memorial thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Leviticus||2||10||And that which is left of the meal-offering shall be Aarons and his sons: it is a thing most holy of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire.
Leviticus||2||11||No meal-offering, which ye shall offer unto Jehovah, shall be made with leaven; for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, as an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Leviticus||2||12||As an oblation of first -fruits ye shall offer them unto Jehovah: but they shall not come up for a sweet savor on the altar.
Leviticus||2||13||And every oblation of thy meal-offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meal-offering: with all thine oblations thou shalt offer salt.
Leviticus||2||14||And if thou offer a meal-offering of first-fruits unto Jehovah, thou shalt offer for the meal-offering of thy first-fruits grain in the ear parched with fire, bruised grain of the fresh ear.
Leviticus||2||15||And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it is a meal-offering.
Leviticus||2||16||And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the bruised grain thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Leviticus||3||1||And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace-offerings; if he offer of the herd, whether male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before Jehovah.
Leviticus||3||2||And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his oblation, and kill it at the door of the tent of meeting: and Aarons sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.
Leviticus||3||3||And he shall offer of the sacrifice of peace-offerings an offering made by fire unto Jehovah; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,
Leviticus||3||4||and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away.
Leviticus||3||5||And Aarons sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt-offering, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Leviticus||3||6||And if his oblation for a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto Jehovah be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it without blemish.
Leviticus||3||7||If he offer a lamb for his oblation, then shall he offer it before Jehovah;
Leviticus||3||8||and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his oblation, and kill it before the tent of meeting: and Aarons sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about.
Leviticus||3||9||And he shall offer of the sacrifice of peace-offerings an offering made by fire unto Jehovah; the fat thereof, the fat tail entire, he shall take away hard by the backbone; and the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,
Leviticus||3||10||and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away.
Leviticus||3||11||And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Leviticus||3||12||And if his oblation be a goat, then he shall offer it before Jehovah:
Leviticus||3||13||and he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before the tent of meeting; and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about.
Leviticus||3||14||And he shall offer thereof his oblation, even an offering made by fire unto Jehovah; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,
Leviticus||3||15||and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away.
Leviticus||3||16||And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire, for a sweet savor; all the fat is Jehovahs.
Leviticus||3||17||It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings, that ye shall eat neither fat nor blood.
Leviticus||4||1||And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus||4||2||Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any one shall sin unwittingly, in any of the things which Jehovah hath commanded not to be done, and shall do any one of them:
Leviticus||4||3||if the anointed priest shall sin so as to bring guilt on the people, then let him offer for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto Jehovah for a sin-offering.
Leviticus||4||4||And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tent of meeting before Jehovah; and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the bullock, and kill the bullock before Jehovah.
Leviticus||4||5||And the anointed priest shall take of the blood of the bullock, and bring it to the tent of meeting:
Leviticus||4||6||and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before Jehovah, before the veil of the sanctuary.
Leviticus||4||7||And the priest shall put of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before Jehovah, which is in the tent of meeting; and all the blood of the bullock shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus||4||8||And all the fat of the bullock of the sin-offering he shall take off from it; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,
Leviticus||4||9||and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away,
Leviticus||4||10||as it is taken off from the ox of the sacrifice of peace-offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of burnt-offering.
Leviticus||4||11||And the skin of the bullock, and all its flesh, with its head, and with its legs, and its inwards, and its dung,
Leviticus||4||12||even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall it be burnt.
Leviticus||4||13||And if the whole congregation of Israel err, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done any of the things which Jehovah hath commanded not to be done, and are guilty;
Leviticus||4||14||when the sin wherein they have sinned is known, then the assembly shall offer a young bullock for a sin-offering, and bring it before the tent of meeting.
Leviticus||4||15||And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before Jehovah; and the bullock shall be killed before Jehovah.
Leviticus||4||16||And the anointed priest shall bring of the blood of the bullock to the tent of meeting:
Leviticus||4||17||and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before Jehovah, before the veil.
Leviticus||4||18||And he shall put of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before Jehovah, that is in the tent of meeting; and all the blood shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus||4||19||And all the fat thereof shall he take off from it, and burn it upon the altar.
Leviticus||4||20||Thus shall he do with the bullock; as he did with the bullock of the sin-offering, so shall he do with this; and the priest shall make atonement for them, and they shall be forgiven.
Leviticus||4||21||And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn it as he burned the first bullock: it is the sin-offering for the assembly.
Leviticus||4||22||When a ruler sinneth, and doeth unwittingly any one of all the things which Jehovah his God hath commanded not to be done, and is guilty;
Leviticus||4||23||if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, be made known to him, he shall bring for his oblation a goat, a male without blemish.
Leviticus||4||24||And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt-offering before Jehovah: it is a sin-offering.
Leviticus||4||25||And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; and the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering.
Leviticus||4||26||And all the fat thereof shall he burn upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin, and he shall be forgiven.
Leviticus||4||27||And if any one of the common people sin unwittingly, in doing any of the things which Jehovah hath commanded not to be done, and be guilty;
Leviticus||4||28||if his sin, which he hath sinned, be made known to him, then he shall bring for his oblation a goat, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned.
Leviticus||4||29||And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin-offering, and kill the sin-offering in the place of burnt-offering.
Leviticus||4||30||And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; and all the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar.
Leviticus||4||31||And all the fat thereof shall he take away, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savor unto Jehovah; and the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be forgiven.
Leviticus||4||32||And if he bring a lamb as his oblation for a sin-offering, he shall bring it a female without blemish.
Leviticus||4||33||And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin-offering, and kill it for a sin-offering in the place where they kill the burnt-offering.
Leviticus||4||34||And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; and all the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar:
Leviticus||4||35||and all the fat thereof shall he take away, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest shall burn them on the altar, upon the offerings of Jehovah made by fire; and the priest shall make atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned, and he shall be forgiven.
Leviticus||5||1||And if any one sin, in that he heareth the voice of adjuration, he being a witness, whether he hath seen or known, if he do not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity.
Leviticus||5||2||Or if any one touch any unclean thing, whether it be the carcass of an unclean beast, or the carcass of unclean cattle, or the carcass of unclean creeping things, and it be hidden from him, and he be unclean, then he shall be guilty.
Leviticus||5||3||Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever his uncleanness be wherewith he is unclean, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty.
Leviticus||5||4||Or if any one swear rashly with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall utter rashly with an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in one of these things.
Leviticus||5||5||And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things, that he shall confess that wherein he hath sinned:
Leviticus||5||6||and he shall bring his trespass-offering unto Jehovah for his sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat, for a sin-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin.
Leviticus||5||7||And if his means suffice not for a lamb, then he shall bring his trespass-offering for that wherein he hath sinned, two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, unto Jehovah; one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering.
Leviticus||5||8||And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that which is for the sin-offering first, and wring off its head from its neck, but shall not divide it asunder:
Leviticus||5||9||and he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin-offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar: it is a sin-offering.
Leviticus||5||10||And he shall offer the second for a burnt-offering, according to the ordinance; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin which he hath sinned, and he shall be forgiven.
Leviticus||5||11||But if his means suffice not for two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, then he shall bring his oblation for that wherein he hath sinned, the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin-offering: he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon; for it is a sin-offering.
Leviticus||5||12||And he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it as the memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar, upon the offerings of Jehovah made by fire: it is a sin-offering.
Leviticus||5||13||And the priest shall make atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned in any of these things, and he shall be forgiven: and the remnant shall be the priests, as the meal-offering.
Leviticus||5||14||And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus||5||15||If any one commit a trespass, and sin unwittingly, in the holy things of Jehovah; then he shall bring his trespass-offering unto Jehovah, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to thy estimation in silver by shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass-offering:
Leviticus||5||16||and he shall make restitution for that which he hath done amiss in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering, and he shall be forgiven.
Leviticus||5||17||And if any one sin, and do any of the things which Jehovah hath commanded not to be done; though he knew it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.
Leviticus||5||18||And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to thy estimation, for a trespass-offering, unto the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him concerning the thing wherein he erred unwittingly and knew it not, and he shall be forgiven.
Leviticus||5||19||It is a trespass-offering: he is certainly guilty before Jehovah.
Leviticus||6||1||And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus||6||2||If any one sin, and commit a trespass against Jehovah, and deal falsely with his neighbor in a matter of deposit, or of bargain, or of robbery, or have oppressed his neighbor,
Leviticus||6||3||or have found that which was lost, and deal falsely therein, and swear to a lie; in any of all these things that a man doeth, sinning therein;
Leviticus||6||4||then it shall be, if he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took by robbery, or the thing which he hath gotten by oppression, or the deposit which was committed to him, or the lost thing which he found,
Leviticus||6||5||or any thing about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even restore it in full, and shall add the fifth part more thereto: unto him to whom it appertaineth shall he give it, in the day of his being found guilty.
Leviticus||6||6||And he shall bring his trespass-offering unto Jehovah, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to thy estimation, for a trespass-offering, unto the priest:
Leviticus||6||7||and the priest shall make atonement for him before Jehovah; and he shall be forgiven concerning whatsoever he doeth so as to be guilty thereby.
Leviticus||6||8||And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus||6||9||Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt-offering: the burnt-offering shall be on the hearth upon the altar all night unto the morning; and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning thereon.
Leviticus||6||10||And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh; and he shall take up the ashes whereto the fire hath consumed the burnt-offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.
Leviticus||6||11||And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.
Leviticus||6||12||And the fire upon the altar shall be kept burning thereon, it shall not go out; and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning: and he shall lay the burnt-offering in order upon it, and shall burn thereon the fat of the peace-offerings.
Leviticus||6||13||Fire shall be kept burning upon the altar continually; it shall not go out.
Leviticus||6||14||And this is the law of the meal-offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before Jehovah, before the altar.
Leviticus||6||15||And he shall take up therefrom his handful, of the fine flour of the meal-offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is upon the meal-offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savor, as the memorial thereof, unto Jehovah.
Leviticus||6||16||And that which is left thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: it shall be eaten without leaven in a holy place; in the court of the tent of meeting they shall eat it.
Leviticus||6||17||It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it as their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as the sin-offering, and as the trespass-offering.
Leviticus||6||18||Every male among the children of Aaron shall eat of it, as his portion for ever throughout your generations, from the offerings of Jehovah made by fire: whosoever toucheth them shall be holy.
Leviticus||6||19||And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus||6||20||This is the oblation of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto Jehovah in the day when he is anointed: the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering perpetually, half of it in the morning, and half thereof in the evening.
Leviticus||6||21||On a baking-pan it shall be made with oil; when it is soaked, thou shalt bring it in: in baken pieces shalt thou offer the meal-offering for a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Leviticus||6||22||And the anointed priest that shall be in his stead from among his sons shall offer it: by a statute for ever it shall be wholly burnt unto Jehovah.
Leviticus||6||23||And every meal-offering of the priest shall be wholly burnt: it shall not be eaten.
Leviticus||6||24||And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus||6||25||Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin-offering: in the place where the burnt-offering is killed shall the sin-offering be killed before Jehovah: it is most holy.
Leviticus||6||26||The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in a holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus||6||27||Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy; and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in a holy place.
Leviticus||6||28||But the earthen vessel wherein it is boiled shall be broken; and if it be boiled in a brazen vessel, it shall be scoured, and rinsed in water.
Leviticus||6||29||Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most holy.
Leviticus||6||30||And no sin-offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the holy place, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt with fire.
Leviticus||7||1||And this is the law of the trespass-offering: it is most holy.
Leviticus||7||2||In the place where they kill the burnt-offering shall they kill the trespass-offering; and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle upon the altar round about.
Leviticus||7||3||And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof: the fat tail, and the fat that covereth the inwards,
Leviticus||7||4||and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the caul upon the liver, with the kidneys, shall he take away;
Leviticus||7||5||and the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto Jehovah: it is a trespass-offering.
Leviticus||7||6||Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten in a holy place: it is most holy.
Leviticus||7||7||As is the sin-offering, so is the trespass-offering; there is one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith, he shall have it.
Leviticus||7||8||And the priest that offereth any mans burnt-offering, even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt-offering which he hath offered.
Leviticus||7||9||And every meal-offering that is baken in the oven, and all that is dressed in the frying-pan, and on the baking-pan, shall be the priests that offereth it.
Leviticus||7||10||And every meal-offering, mingled with oil, or dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as well as another.
Leviticus||7||11||And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which one shall offer unto Jehovah.
Leviticus||7||12||If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour soaked.
Leviticus||7||13||With cakes of leavened bread he shall offer his oblation with the sacrifice of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving.
Leviticus||7||14||And of it he shall offer one out of each oblation for a heave-offering unto Jehovah; it shall be the priests that sprinkleth the blood of the peace-offerings.
Leviticus||7||15||And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten on the day of his oblation; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.
Leviticus||7||16||But if the sacrifice of his oblation be a vow, or a freewill-offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he offereth his sacrifice; and on the morrow that which remaineth of it shall be eaten:
Leviticus||7||17||but that which remaineth of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire.
Leviticus||7||18||And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings be eaten on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.
Leviticus||7||19||And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire. And as for the flesh, every one that is clean shall eat thereof:
Leviticus||7||20||but the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, that pertain unto Jehovah, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from his people.
Leviticus||7||21||And when any one shall touch any unclean thing, the uncleanness of man, or an unclean beast, or any unclean abomination, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which pertain unto Jehovah, that soul shall be cut off from his people.
Leviticus||7||22||And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus||7||23||Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat.
Leviticus||7||24||And the fat of that which dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn of beasts, may be used for any other service; but ye shall in no wise eat of it.
Leviticus||7||25||For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people.
Leviticus||7||26||And ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of bird or of beast, in any of your dwellings.
Leviticus||7||27||Whosoever it be that eateth any blood, that soul shall be cut off from his people.
Leviticus||7||28||And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus||7||29||Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace-offerings unto Jehovah shall bring his oblation unto Jehovah out of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings:
Leviticus||7||30||his own hands shall bring the offerings of Jehovah made by fire; the fat with the breast shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave-offering before Jehovah.
Leviticus||7||31||And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar; but the breast shall be Aarons and his sons.
Leviticus||7||32||And the right thigh shall ye give unto the priest for a heave-offering out of the sacrifices of your peace-offerings.
Leviticus||7||33||He among the sons of Aaron that offereth the blood of the peace-offerings, and the fat, shall have the right thigh for a portion.
Leviticus||7||34||For the wave-breast and the heave-thigh have I taken of the children of Israel out of the sacrifices of their peace-offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons as their portion for ever from the children of Israel.
Leviticus||7||35||This is the anointing-portion of Aaron, and the anointing-portion of his sons, out of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister unto Jehovah in the priests office;
Leviticus||7||36||which Jehovah commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them. It is their portion for ever throughout their generations.
Leviticus||7||37||This is the law of the burnt-offering, of the meal-offering, and of the sin-offering, and of the trespass-offering, and of the consecration, and of the sacrifice of peace-offerings;
Leviticus||7||38||which Jehovah commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto Jehovah, in the wilderness of Sinai.
Leviticus||8||1||And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus||8||2||Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and the bullock of the sin-offering, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread;
Leviticus||8||3||and assemble thou all the congregation at the door of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus||8||4||And Moses did as Jehovah commanded him; and the congregation was assembled at the door of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus||8||5||And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded to be done.
Leviticus||8||6||And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.
Leviticus||8||7||And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the skilfully woven band of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith.
Leviticus||8||8||And he placed the breastplate upon him: and in the breastplate he put the Urim and the Thummim.
Leviticus||8||9||And he set the mitre upon his head; and upon the mitre, in front, did he set the golden plate, the holy crown; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Leviticus||8||10||And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them.
Leviticus||8||11||And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its vessels, and the laver and its base, to sanctify them.
Leviticus||8||12||And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aarons head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.
Leviticus||8||13||And Moses brought Aarons sons, and clothed them with coats, and girded them with girdles, and bound head-tires upon them; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Leviticus||8||14||And he brought the bullock of the sin-offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock of the sin-offering.
Leviticus||8||15||And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar, and sanctified it, to make atonement for it.
Leviticus||8||16||And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat; and Moses burned it upon the altar.
Leviticus||8||17||But the bullock, and its skin, and its flesh, and its dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Leviticus||8||18||And he presented the ram of the burnt-offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
Leviticus||8||19||And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
Leviticus||8||20||And he cut the ram into its pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat.
Leviticus||8||21||And he washed the inwards and the legs with water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt-offering for a sweet savor: it was an offering made by fire unto Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Leviticus||8||22||And he presented the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
Leviticus||8||23||And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood thereof, and put it upon the tip of Aarons right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.
Leviticus||8||24||And he brought Aarons sons; and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
Leviticus||8||25||And he took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right thigh:
Leviticus||8||26||and out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before Jehovah, he took one unleavened cake, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and placed them on the fat, and upon the right thigh:
Leviticus||8||27||and he put the whole upon the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons, and waved them for a wave-offering before Jehovah.
Leviticus||8||28||And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt-offering: they were a consecration for a sweet savor: it was an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Leviticus||8||29||And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave-offering before Jehovah: it was Moses portion of the ram of consecration; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Leviticus||8||30||And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons garments with him, and sanctified Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and his sons garments with him.
Leviticus||8||31||And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tent of meeting: and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of consecration, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.
Leviticus||8||32||And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire.
Leviticus||8||33||And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting seven days, until the days of your consecration be fulfilled: for he shall consecrate you seven days.
Leviticus||8||34||As hath been done this day, so Jehovah hath commanded to do, to make atonement for you.
Leviticus||8||35||And at the door of the tent of meeting shall ye abide day and night seven days, and keep the charge of Jehovah, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.
Leviticus||8||36||And Aaron and his sons did all the things which Jehovah commanded by Moses.
Leviticus||9||1||And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;
Leviticus||9||2||and he said unto Aaron, Take thee a calf of the herd for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering, without blemish, and offer them before Jehovah.
Leviticus||9||3||And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a he-goat for a sin-offering; and a calf and a lamb, both a year old, without blemish, for a burnt-offering;
Leviticus||9||4||and an ox and a ram for peace-offerings, to sacrifice before Jehovah; and a meal-offering mingled with oil: for to-day Jehovah appeareth unto you.
Leviticus||9||5||And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tent of meeting: and all the congregation drew near and stood before Jehovah.
Leviticus||9||6||And Moses said, This is the thing which Jehovah commanded that ye should do: and the glory of Jehovah shall appear unto you.
Leviticus||9||7||And Moses said unto Aaron, Draw near unto the altar, and offer thy sin-offering, and thy burnt-offering, and make atonement for thyself, and for the people; and offer the oblation of the people, and make atonement for them; as Jehovah commanded.
Leviticus||9||8||So Aaron drew near unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin-offering, which was for himself.
Leviticus||9||9||And the sons of Aaron presented the blood unto him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar:
Leviticus||9||10||but the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul from the liver of the sin-offering, he burnt upon the altar; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Leviticus||9||11||And the flesh and the skin he burnt with fire without the camp.
Leviticus||9||12||And he slew the burnt-offering; and Aarons sons delivered unto him the blood, and he sprinkled it upon the altar round about.
Leviticus||9||13||And they delivered the burnt-offering unto him, piece by piece, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.
Leviticus||9||14||And he washed the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt-offering on the altar.
Leviticus||9||15||And he presented the peoples oblation, and took the goat of the sin-offering which was for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.
Leviticus||9||16||And he presented the burnt-offering, and offered it according to the ordinance.
Leviticus||9||17||And he presented the meal-offering, and filled his hand therefrom, and burnt it upon the altar, besides the burnt-offering of the morning.
Leviticus||9||18||He slew also the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which was for the people: and Aarons sons delivered unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,
Leviticus||9||19||and the fat of the ox and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul of the liver:
Leviticus||9||20||and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:
Leviticus||9||21||and the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave-offering before Jehovah; as Moses commanded.
Leviticus||9||22||And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings.
Leviticus||9||23||And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of Jehovah appeared unto all the people.
Leviticus||9||24||And there came forth fire from before Jehovah, and consumed upon the altar the burnt-offering and the fat: and when all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces.
Leviticus||10||1||And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took each of them his censer, and put fire therein, and laid incense thereon, and offered strange fire before Jehovah, which he had not commanded them.
Leviticus||10||2||And there came forth fire from before Jehovah, and devoured them, and they died before Jehovah.
Leviticus||10||3||Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that Jehovah spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.
Leviticus||10||4||And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Draw near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.
Leviticus||10||5||So they drew near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses had said.
Leviticus||10||6||And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Let not the hair of your heads go loose, neither rend your clothes; that ye die not, and that he be not wroth with all the congregation: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which Jehovah hath kindled.
Leviticus||10||7||And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting, lest ye die; for the anointing oil of Jehovah is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.
Leviticus||10||8||And Jehovah spake unto Aaron, saying,
Leviticus||10||9||Drink no wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tent of meeting, that ye die not: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations:
Leviticus||10||10||and that ye may make a distinction between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean;
Leviticus||10||11||and that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which Jehovah hath spoken unto them by Moses.
Leviticus||10||12||And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meal-offering that remaineth of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar; for it is most holy;
Leviticus||10||13||and ye shall eat it in a holy place, because it is thy portion, and thy sons portion, of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire: for so I am commanded.
Leviticus||10||14||And the wave-breast and the heave-thigh shall ye eat in a clean place, thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they are given as thy portion, and thy sons portion, out of the sacrifices of the peace-offerings of the children of Israel.
Leviticus||10||15||The heave-thigh and the wave-breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave-offering before Jehovah: and it shall be thine, and thy sons with thee, as a portion for ever; as Jehovah hath commanded.
Leviticus||10||16||And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin-offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the sons of Aaron that were left, saying,
Leviticus||10||17||Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin-offering in the place of the sanctuary, seeing it is most holy, and he hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before Jehovah?
Leviticus||10||18||Behold, the blood of it was not brought into the sanctuary within: ye should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.
Leviticus||10||19||And Aaron spake unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin-offering and their burnt-offering before Jehovah; and there have befallen me such things as these: and if I had eaten the sin-offering to-day, would it have been well-pleasing in the sight of Jehovah?
Leviticus||10||20||And when Moses heard that, it was well-pleasing in his sight.
Leviticus||11||1||And Jehovah spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,
Leviticus||11||2||Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the living things which ye may eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.
Leviticus||11||3||Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that may ye eat.
Leviticus||11||4||Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that part the hoof: the camel, because he cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, he is unclean unto you.
Leviticus||11||5||And the coney, because he cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, he is unclean unto you.
Leviticus||11||6||And the hare, because she cheweth the cud but parteth not the hoof, she is unclean unto you.
Leviticus||11||7||And the swine, because he parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, but cheweth not the cud, he is unclean unto you.
Leviticus||11||8||Of their flesh ye shall not eat, and their carcasses ye shall not touch; they are unclean unto you.
Leviticus||11||9||These may ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, that may ye eat.
Leviticus||11||10||And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of all the living creatures that are in the waters, they are an abomination unto you,
Leviticus||11||11||and they shall be an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, and their carcasses ye shall have in abomination.
Leviticus||11||12||Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that is an abomination unto you.
Leviticus||11||13||And these ye shall have in abomination among the birds; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the gier-eagle, and the ospray,
Leviticus||11||14||and the kite, and the falcon after its kind,
Leviticus||11||15||every raven after its kind,
Leviticus||11||16||and the ostrich, and the night-hawk, and the seamew, and the hawk after its kind,
Leviticus||11||17||and the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,
Leviticus||11||18||and the horned owl, and the pelican, and the vulture,
Leviticus||11||19||and the stork, the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe, and the bat.
Leviticus||11||20||All winged creeping things that go upon all fours are an abomination unto you.
Leviticus||11||21||Yet these may ye eat of all winged creeping things that go upon all fours, which have legs above their feet, wherewith to leap upon the earth.
Leviticus||11||22||Even these of them ye may eat: the locust after its kind, and the bald locust after its kind, and the cricket after its kind, and the grasshopper after its kind.
Leviticus||11||23||But all winged creeping things, which have four feet, are an abomination unto you.
Leviticus||11||24||And by these ye shall become unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcass of them shall be unclean until the even;
Leviticus||11||25||And whosoever beareth aught of the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus||11||26||Every beast which parteth the hoof, and is not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, is unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.
Leviticus||11||27||And whatsoever goeth upon its paws, among all beasts that go on all fours, they are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcass shall be unclean until the even.
Leviticus||11||28||And he that beareth the carcass of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you.
Leviticus||11||29||And these are they which are unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth: the weasel, and the mouse, and the great lizard after its kind,
Leviticus||11||30||and the gecko, and the land-crocodile, and the lizard, and the sand-lizard, and the chameleon.
Leviticus||11||31||These are they which are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they are dead, shall be unclean until the even.
Leviticus||11||32||And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherewith any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; then shall it be clean.
Leviticus||11||33||And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth, whatsoever is in it shall be unclean, and it ye shall break.
Leviticus||11||34||All food therein which may be eaten, that on which water cometh, shall be unclean; and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean.
Leviticus||11||35||And every thing whereupon any part of their carcass falleth shall be unclean; whether oven, or range for pots, it shall be broken in pieces: they are unclean, and shall be unclean unto you.
Leviticus||11||36||Nevertheless a fountain or a pit wherein is a gathering of water shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcass shall be unclean.
Leviticus||11||37||And if aught of their carcass fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it is clean.
Leviticus||11||38||But if water be put upon the seed, and aught of their carcass fall thereon, it is unclean unto you.
Leviticus||11||39||And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcass thereof shall be unclean until the even.
Leviticus||11||40||And he that eateth of the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcass of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus||11||41||And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth is an abomination; it shall not be eaten.
Leviticus||11||42||Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all fours, or whatsoever hath many feet, even all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an abomination.
Leviticus||11||43||Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.
Leviticus||11||44||For I am Jehovah your God: sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy; for I am holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that moveth upon the earth.
Leviticus||11||45||For I am Jehovah that brought you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.
Leviticus||11||46||This is the law of the beast, and of the bird, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth;
Leviticus||11||47||to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean, and between the living thing that may be eaten and the living thing that may not be eaten.
Leviticus||12||1||And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus||12||2||Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman conceive seed, and bear a man-child, then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of the impurity of her sickness shall she be unclean.
Leviticus||12||3||And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.
Leviticus||12||4||And she shall continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.
Leviticus||12||5||But if she bear a maid-child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her impurity; and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days.
Leviticus||12||6||And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb a year old for a burnt-offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtle-dove, for a sin-offering, unto the door of the tent of meeting, unto the priest:
Leviticus||12||7||and he shall offer it before Jehovah, and make atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the fountain of her blood. This is the law for her that beareth, whether a male or a female.
Leviticus||12||8||And if her means suffice not for a lamb, then she shall take two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons; the one for a burnt-offering, and the other for a sin-offering: and the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean.
Leviticus||13||1||And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
Leviticus||13||2||When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, or a scab, or a bright spot, and it become in the skin of his flesh the plague of leprosy, then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests:
Leviticus||13||3||and the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and if the hair in the plague be turned white, and the appearance of the plague be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is the plague of leprosy; and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.
Leviticus||13||4||And if the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white, then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days:
Leviticus||13||5||and the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, if in his eyes the plague be at a stay, and the plague be not spread in the skin, then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:
Leviticus||13||6||and the priest shall look on him again the seventh day; and, behold, if the plague be dim, and the plague be not spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
Leviticus||13||7||But if the scab spread abroad in the skin, after that he hath showed himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall show himself to the priest again:
Leviticus||13||8||and the priest shall look; and, behold, if the scab be spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is leprosy.
Leviticus||13||9||When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest;
Leviticus||13||10||and the priest shall look; and, behold, if there be a white rising in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and there be quick raw flesh in the rising,
Leviticus||13||11||it is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean: he shall not shut him up, for he is unclean.
Leviticus||13||12||And if the leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to his feet, as far as appeareth to the priest;
Leviticus||13||13||then the priest shall look; and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: it is all turned white: he is clean.
Leviticus||13||14||But whensoever raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.
Leviticus||13||15||And the priest shall look on the raw flesh, and pronounce him unclean: the raw flesh is unclean: it is leprosy.
Leviticus||13||16||Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, then he shall come unto the priest;
Leviticus||13||17||and the priest shall look on him; and, behold, if the plague be turned into white, then the priest shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: he is clean.
Leviticus||13||18||And when the flesh hath in the skin thereof a boil, and it is healed,
Leviticus||13||19||and in the place of the boil there is a white rising, or a bright spot, reddish-white, then is shall be showed to the priest;
Leviticus||13||20||and the priest shall look; and, behold, if the appearance thereof be lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy, it hath broken out in the boil.
Leviticus||13||21||But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hairs therein, and it be not lower than the skin, but be dim; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:
Leviticus||13||22||And if it spread abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague.
Leviticus||13||23||But if the bright spot stay in its place, and be not spread, it is the scar of the boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
Leviticus||13||24||Or when the flesh hath in the skin thereof a burning by fire, and the quick flesh of the burning become a bright spot, reddish-white, or white;
Leviticus||13||25||then the priest shall look upon it; and, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and the appearance thereof be deeper than the skin; it is leprosy, it hath broken out in the burning: and the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.
Leviticus||13||26||But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the skin, but be dim; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:
Leviticus||13||27||and the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: if it spread abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.
Leviticus||13||28||And if the bright spot stay in its place, and be not spread in the skin, but be dim; it is the rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is the scar of the burning.
Leviticus||13||29||And when a man or woman hath a plague upon the head or upon the beard,
Leviticus||13||30||then the priest shall look on the plague; and, behold, if the appearance thereof be deeper than the skin, and there be in it yellow thin hair, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a scall, it is leprosy of the head or of the beard.
Leviticus||13||31||And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin, and there be no black hair in it, then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of the scall seven days:
Leviticus||13||32||And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague; and, behold, if the scall be not spread, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the appearance of the scall be not deeper than the skin,
Leviticus||13||33||then he shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more:
Leviticus||13||34||and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall; and, behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, and the appearance thereof be not deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
Leviticus||13||35||But if the scall spread abroad in the skin after his cleansing,
Leviticus||13||36||then the priest shall look on him; and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for the yellow hair; he is unclean.
Leviticus||13||37||But if in his eyes the scall be at a stay, and black hair be grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
Leviticus||13||38||And when a man or a woman hath in the skin of the flesh bright spots, even white bright spots;
Leviticus||13||39||then the priest shall look; and, behold, if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be of a dull white, it is a tetter, it hath broken out in the skin; he is clean.
Leviticus||13||40||And if a mans hair be fallen off his head, he is bald; yet is he clean.
Leviticus||13||41||And if his hair be fallen off from the front part of his head, he is forehead bald; yet is he clean.
Leviticus||13||42||But if there be in the bald head, or the bald forehead, a reddish-white plague; it is leprosy breaking out in his bald head, or his bald forehead.
Leviticus||13||43||Then the priest shall look upon him; and, behold, if the rising of the plague be reddish-white in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the flesh;
Leviticus||13||44||he is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall surely pronounce him unclean; his plague is in his head.
Leviticus||13||45||And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and the hair of his head shall go loose, and he shall cover his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.
Leviticus||13||46||All the days wherein the plague is in him he shall be unclean; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his dwelling be.
Leviticus||13||47||The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be a woollen garment, or a linen garment;
Leviticus||13||48||whether it be in warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in anything made of skin;
Leviticus||13||49||if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin; it is the plague of leprosy, and shall be showed unto the priest.
Leviticus||13||50||And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up that which hath the plague seven days:
Leviticus||13||51||and he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in the skin, whatever service skin is used for; the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.
Leviticus||13||52||And he shall burn the garment, whether the warp or the woof, in woollen or in linen, or anything of skin, wherein the plague is: for it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.
Leviticus||13||53||And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin;
Leviticus||13||54||then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:
Leviticus||13||55||and the priest shall look, after that the plague is washed; and, behold, if the plague have not changed its color, and the plague be not spread, it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire: it is a fret, whether the bareness be within or without.
Leviticus||13||56||And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be dim after the washing thereof, then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:
Leviticus||13||57||and if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin, it is breaking out: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire.
Leviticus||13||58||And the garment, either the warp, or the woof, or whatsoever thing of skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.
Leviticus||13||59||This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or the woof, or anything of skin, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.
Leviticus||14||1||And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus||14||2||This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: he shall be brought unto the priest:
Leviticus||14||3||and the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall look; and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper,
Leviticus||14||4||then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two living clean birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:
Leviticus||14||5||And the priest shall command to kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water.
Leviticus||14||6||As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water:
Leviticus||14||7||And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let go the living bird into the open field.
Leviticus||14||8||And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and bathe himself in water; and he shall be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, but shall dwell outside his tent seven days.
Leviticus||14||9||And it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.
Leviticus||14||10||And on the eighth day he shall take two he-lambs without blemish, and one ewe-lamb a year old without blemish, and three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil.
Leviticus||14||11||And the priest that cleanseth him shall set the man that is to be cleansed, and those things, before Jehovah, at the door of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus||14||12||And the priest shall take one of the he-lambs, and offer him for a trespass-offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave-offering before Jehovah:
Leviticus||14||13||and he shall kill the he-lamb in the place where they kill the sin-offering and the burnt-offering, in the place of the sanctuary: for as the sin-offering is the priests, so is the trespass-offering: it is most holy:
Leviticus||14||14||and the priest shall take of the blood of the trespass-offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.
Leviticus||14||15||And the priest shall take of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand;
Leviticus||14||16||and the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before Jehovah:
Leviticus||14||17||and of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass-offering:
Leviticus||14||18||and the rest of the oil that is in the priests hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest shall make atonement for him before Jehovah.
Leviticus||14||19||And the priest shall offer the sin-offering, and make atonement for him that is to be cleansed because of his uncleanness: and afterward he shall kill the burnt-offering;
Leviticus||14||20||and the priest shall offer the burnt-offering and the meal-offering upon the altar: and the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be clean.
Leviticus||14||21||And if he be poor, and cannot get so much, then he shall take one he-lamb for a trespass-offering to be waved, to make atonement for him, and one tenth part of an ephah of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal-offering, and a log of oil;
Leviticus||14||22||and two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one shall be a sin-offering, and the other a burnt-offering.
Leviticus||14||23||And on the eighth day he shall bring them for his cleansing unto the priest, unto the door of the tent of meeting, before Jehovah:
Leviticus||14||24||and the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass-offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave-offering before Jehovah.
Leviticus||14||25||And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass-offering; and the priest shall take of the blood of the trespass-offering, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.
Leviticus||14||26||And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left hand;
Leviticus||14||27||and the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before Jehovah:
Leviticus||14||28||and the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass-offering:
Leviticus||14||29||and the rest of the oil that is in the priests hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make atonement for him before Jehovah.
Leviticus||14||30||And he shall offer one of the turtle-doves, or of the young pigeons, such as he is able to get,
Leviticus||14||31||even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, with the meal-offering: and the priest shall make atonement for him that is to be cleansed before Jehovah.
Leviticus||14||32||This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, who is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing.
Leviticus||14||33||And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
Leviticus||14||34||When ye are come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession;
Leviticus||14||35||then he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, There seemeth to me to be as it were a plague in the house.
Leviticus||14||36||And the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest goeth in to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house:
Leviticus||14||37||and he shall look on the plague; and, behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish, and the appearance thereof be lower than the wall;
Leviticus||14||38||then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days.
Leviticus||14||39||And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look; and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the house;
Leviticus||14||40||then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which the plague is, and cast them into an unclean place without the city:
Leviticus||14||41||and he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the mortar, that they scrape off, without the city into an unclean place:
Leviticus||14||42||and they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house.
Leviticus||14||43||And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken out the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plastered;
Leviticus||14||44||then the priest shall come in and look; and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house: it is unclean.
Leviticus||14||45||And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the mortar of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place.
Leviticus||14||46||Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even.
Leviticus||14||47||And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.
Leviticus||14||48||And if the priest shall come in, and look, and, behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plastered; then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.
Leviticus||14||49||And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:
Leviticus||14||50||and he shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water:
Leviticus||14||51||and he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times:
Leviticus||14||52||and he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:
Leviticus||14||53||but he shall let got the living bird out of the city into the open field: so shall he make atonement for the house; and it shall be clean.
Leviticus||14||54||This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and for a scall,
Leviticus||14||55||and for the leprosy of a garment, and for a house,
Leviticus||14||56||and for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot;
Leviticus||14||57||to teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the law of leprosy.
Leviticus||15||1||And Jehovah spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying,
Leviticus||15||2||Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man hath an issue out of his flesh, because of his issue he is unclean.
Leviticus||15||3||And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his flesh run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it is his uncleanness.
Leviticus||15||4||Every bed whereon he that hath the issue lieth shall be unclean; and everything whereon he sitteth shall be unclean.
Leviticus||15||5||And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus||15||6||And he that sitteth on anything whereon he that hath the issue sat shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus||15||7||And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus||15||8||And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean, then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus||15||9||And what saddle soever he that hath the issue rideth upon shall be unclean.
Leviticus||15||10||And whosoever toucheth anything that was under him shall be unclean until the even: and he that beareth those things shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus||15||11||And whomsoever he that hath the issue toucheth, without having rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus||15||12||And the earthen vessel, which he that hath the issue toucheth, shall be broken; and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water.
Leviticus||15||13||And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue, then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes; and he shall bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean.
Leviticus||15||14||And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, and come before Jehovah unto the door of the tent of meeting, and give them unto the priest:
Leviticus||15||15||and the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him before Jehovah for his issue.
Leviticus||15||16||And if any mans seed of copulation go out from him, then he shall bathe all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus||15||17||And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the seed of copulation, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus||15||18||The woman also with whom a man shall lie with seed of copulation, they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus||15||19||And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be blood, she shall be in her impurity seven days: and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the even.
Leviticus||15||20||And everything that she lieth upon in her impurity shall be unclean: everything also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean.
Leviticus||15||21||And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus||15||22||And whosoever toucheth anything that she sitteth upon shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus||15||23||And if it be on the bed, or on anything whereon she sitteth, when he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the even.
Leviticus||15||24||And if any man lie with her, and her impurity be upon him, he shall be unclean seven days; and every bed whereon he lieth shall be unclean.
Leviticus||15||25||And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days not in the time of her impurity, or if she have an issue beyond the time of her impurity; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness she shall be as in the days of her impurity: she is unclean.
Leviticus||15||26||Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be unto her as the bed of her impurity: and everything whereon she sitteth shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her impurity.
Leviticus||15||27||And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
Leviticus||15||28||But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.
Leviticus||15||29||And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus||15||30||And the priest shall offer the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for her before Jehovah for the issue of her uncleanness.
Leviticus||15||31||Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness, that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile my tabernacle that is in the midst of them.
Leviticus||15||32||This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed of copulation goeth from him, so that he is unclean thereby;
Leviticus||15||33||and of her that is sick with her impurity, and of him that hath an issue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth with her that is unclean.
Leviticus||16||1||And Jehovah spake unto Moses, after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they drew near before Jehovah, and died;
Leviticus||16||2||and Jehovah said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the veil, before the mercy-seat which is upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy-seat.
Leviticus||16||3||Herewith shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering.
Leviticus||16||4||He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with the linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired: they are the holy garments; and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and put them on.
Leviticus||16||5||And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two he-goats for a sin-offering, and one ram for a burnt-offering.
Leviticus||16||6||And Aaron shall present the bullock of the sin-offering, which is for himself, and make atonement for himself, and for his house.
Leviticus||16||7||And he shall take the two goats, and set them before Jehovah at the door of the tent of meeting.
Leviticus||16||8||And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for Jehovah, and the other lot for Azazel.
Leviticus||16||9||And Aaron shall present the goat upon which the lot fell for Jehovah, and offer him for a sin-offering.
Leviticus||16||10||But the goat, on which the lot fell for Azazel, shall be set alive before Jehovah, to make atonement for him, to send him away for Azazel into the wilderness.
Leviticus||16||11||And Aaron shall present the bullock of the sin-offering, which is for himself, and shall make atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin-offering which is for himself:
Leviticus||16||12||and he shall take a censer full of coals of fire from off the altar before Jehovah, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil:
Leviticus||16||13||and he shall put the incense upon the fire before Jehovah, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy-seat that is upon the testimony, that he die not:
Leviticus||16||14||and he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy-seat on the east; and before the mercy-seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.
Leviticus||16||15||Then shall he kill the goat of the sin-offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the veil, and do with his blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy-seat, and before the mercy-seat:
Leviticus||16||16||and he shall make atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleannesses of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions, even all their sins: and so shall he do for the tent of meeting, that dwelleth with them in the midst of their uncleannesses.
Leviticus||16||17||And there shall be no man in the tent of meeting when he goeth in to make atonement in the holy place, until he come out, and have made atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the assembly of Israel.
Leviticus||16||18||And he shall go out unto the altar that is before Jehovah, and make atonement for it, and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about.
Leviticus||16||19||And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleannesses of the children of Israel.
Leviticus||16||20||And when he hath made an end of atoning for the holy place, and the tent of meeting, and the altar, he shall present the live goat:
Leviticus||16||21||and Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions, even all their sins; and he shall put them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a man that is in readiness into the wilderness:
Leviticus||16||22||and the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a solitary land: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.
Leviticus||16||23||And Aaron shall come into the tent of meeting, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there:
Leviticus||16||24||and he shall bathe his flesh in water in a holy place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt-offering and the burnt-offering of the people, and make atonement for himself and for the people.
Leviticus||16||25||And the fat of the sin-offering shall he burn upon the altar.
Leviticus||16||26||And he that letteth go the goat for Azazel shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.
Leviticus||16||27||And the bullock of the sin-offering, and the goat of the sin-offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall be carried forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.
Leviticus||16||28||And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.
Leviticus||16||29||And it shall be a statute for ever unto you: in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and shall do no manner of work, the home-born, or the stranger that sojourneth among you:
Leviticus||16||30||for on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins shall ye be clean before Jehovah.
Leviticus||16||31||It is a sabbath of solemn rest unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; it is a statute for ever.
Leviticus||16||32||And the priest, who shall be anointed and who shall be consecrated to be priest in his fathers stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen garments, even the holy garments:
Leviticus||16||33||and he shall make atonement for the holy sanctuary; and he shall make atonement for the tent of meeting and for the altar; and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly.
Leviticus||16||34||And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make atonement for the children of Israel because of all their sins once in the year. And he did as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Leviticus||17||1||And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus||17||2||Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them: This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded, saying,
Leviticus||17||3||What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it without the camp,
Leviticus||17||4||and hath not brought it unto the door of the tent of meeting, to offer it as an oblation unto Jehovah before the tabernacle of Jehovah: blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people:
Leviticus||17||5||To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they sacrifice in the open field, even that they may bring them unto Jehovah, unto the door of the tent of meeting, unto the priest, and sacrifice them for sacrifices of peace-offerings unto Jehovah.
Leviticus||17||6||And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of Jehovah at the door of the tent of meeting, and burn the fat for a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Leviticus||17||7||And they shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices unto the he-goats, after which they play the harlot. This shall be a statute forever unto them throughout their generations.
Leviticus||17||8||And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that offereth a burnt-offering or sacrifice,
Leviticus||17||9||and bringeth it not unto the door of the tent of meeting, to sacrifice it unto Jehovah; that man shall be cut off from his people.
Leviticus||17||10||And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that eateth any manner of blood, I will set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people.
Leviticus||17||11||For the life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh atonement by reason of the life.
Leviticus||17||12||Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood.
Leviticus||17||13||And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, who taketh in hunting any beast or bird that may be eaten; he shall pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.
Leviticus||17||14||For as to the life of all flesh, the blood thereof is all one with the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh; for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.
Leviticus||17||15||And every soul that eateth that which dieth of itself, or that which is torn of beasts, whether he be home-born or a sojourner, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean.
Leviticus||17||16||But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh, then he shall bear his iniquity.
Leviticus||18||1||And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus||18||2||Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus||18||3||After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do; neither shall ye walk in their statutes.
Leviticus||18||4||Mine ordinances shall ye do, and my statutes shall ye keep, to walk therein: I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus||18||5||Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and mine ordinances; which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus||18||6||None of you shall approach to any that are near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus||18||7||The nakedness of thy father, even the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
Leviticus||18||8||The nakedness of thy fathers wife shalt thou not uncover: it is thy fathers nakedness.
Leviticus||18||9||The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or the daughter of thy mother, whether born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.
Leviticus||18||10||The nakedness of thy sons daughter, or of thy daughters daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs is thine own nakedness.
Leviticus||18||11||The nakedness of thy fathers wifes daughter, begotten of thy father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
Leviticus||18||12||Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy fathers sister: she is thy fathers near kinswoman.
Leviticus||18||13||Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mothers sister: for she is thy mothers near kinswoman.
Leviticus||18||14||Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy fathers brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt.
Leviticus||18||15||Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter-in-law: she is thy sons wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
Leviticus||18||16||Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brothers wife: it is thy brothers nakedness.
Leviticus||18||17||Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; thou shalt not take her sons daughter, or her daughters daughter, to uncover her nakedness; they are near kinswomen: it is wickedness.
Leviticus||18||18||And thou shalt not take a wife to her sister, to be a rival to her, to uncover her nakedness, besides the other in her life-time.
Leviticus||18||19||And thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is impure by her uncleanness.
Leviticus||18||20||And thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbors wife, to defile thyself with her.
Leviticus||18||21||And thou shalt not give any of thy seed to make them pass through the fire to Molech; neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus||18||22||Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.
Leviticus||18||23||And thou shalt not lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith; neither shall any woman stand before a beast, to lie down thereto: it is confusion.
Leviticus||18||24||Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out from before you;
Leviticus||18||25||And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land vomiteth out her inhabitants.
Leviticus||18||26||Ye therefore shall keep my statutes and mine ordinances, and shall not do any of these abominations; neither the home-born, nor the stranger that sojourneth among you;
Leviticus||18||27||(for all these abominations have the men of the land done, that were before you, and the land is defiled);
Leviticus||18||28||that the land vomit not you out also, when ye defile it, as it vomited out the nation that was before you.
Leviticus||18||29||For whosoever shall do any of these abominations, even the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people.
Leviticus||18||30||Therefore shall ye keep my charge, that ye practise not any of these abominable customs, which were practised before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus||19||1||And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus||19||2||Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy; for I Jehovah your God am holy.
Leviticus||19||3||Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father; and ye shall keep my sabbaths: I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus||19||4||Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus||19||5||And when ye offer a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto Jehovah, ye shall offer it that ye may be accepted.
Leviticus||19||6||It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if aught remain until the third day, it shall be burnt with fire.
Leviticus||19||7||And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is an abomination; it shall not be accepted:
Leviticus||19||8||but every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the holy thing of Jehovah: and that soul shall be cut off from his people.
Leviticus||19||9||And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest.
Leviticus||19||10||And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather the fallen fruit of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and for the sojourner: I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus||19||11||Ye shall not steal; neither shall ye deal falsely, nor lie one to another.
Leviticus||19||12||And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, and profane the name of thy God: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus||19||13||Thou shalt not oppress thy neighbor, nor rob him: the wages of a hired servant shall not abide with thee all night until the morning.
Leviticus||19||14||Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind; but thou shalt fear thy God: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus||19||15||Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty; but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbor.
Leviticus||19||16||Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbor: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus||19||17||Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart: thou shalt surely rebuke thy neighbor, and not bear sin because of him.
Leviticus||19||18||Thou shalt not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people; but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus||19||19||Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with two kinds of seed: neither shall there come upon thee a garment of two kinds of stuff mingled together.
Leviticus||19||20||And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to a husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; they shall be punished; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.
Leviticus||19||21||And he shall bring his trespass-offering unto Jehovah, unto the door of the tent of meeting, even a ram for a trespass-offering.
Leviticus||19||22||And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering before Jehovah for his sin which he hath sinned: and the sin which he hath sinned shall be forgiven him.
Leviticus||19||23||And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as their uncircumcision: three years shall they be as uncircumcised unto you; it shall not be eaten.
Leviticus||19||24||But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy, for giving praise unto Jehovah.
Leviticus||19||25||And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus||19||26||Ye shall not eat anything with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantments, nor practise augury.
Leviticus||19||27||Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.
Leviticus||19||28||Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus||19||29||Profane not thy daughter, to make her a harlot; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.
Leviticus||19||30||Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary; I am Jehovah.
Leviticus||19||31||Turn ye not unto them that have familiar spirits, nor unto the wizards; seek them not out, to be defiled by them: I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus||19||32||Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of the old man, and thou shalt fear thy God: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus||19||33||And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not do him wrong.
Leviticus||19||34||The stranger that sojourneth with you shall be unto you as the home-born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus||19||35||Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in measures of length, of weight, or of quantity.
Leviticus||19||36||Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.
Leviticus||19||37||And ye shall observe all my statutes, and all mine ordinances, and do them: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus||20||1||And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus||20||2||Moreover, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.
Leviticus||20||3||I also will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.
Leviticus||20||4||And if the people at the land do at all hide their eyes from that man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and put him not to death;
Leviticus||20||5||then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that play the harlot after him, to play the harlot with Molech, from among their people.
Leviticus||20||6||And the soul that turneth unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto the wizards, to play the harlot after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.
Leviticus||20||7||Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy; for I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus||20||8||And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am Jehovah who sanctifieth you.
Leviticus||20||9||For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall surely be put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him.
Leviticus||20||10||And the man that committeth adultery with another mans wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbors wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.
Leviticus||20||11||And the man that lieth with his fathers wife hath uncovered his fathers nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.
Leviticus||20||12||And if a man lie with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall be upon them.
Leviticus||20||13||And if a man lie with mankind, as with womankind, both of them have committed abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.
Leviticus||20||14||And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.
Leviticus||20||15||And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast.
Leviticus||20||16||And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.
Leviticus||20||17||And if a man shall take his sister, his fathers daughter, or his mothers daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a shameful thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of the children of their people: he hath uncovered his sisters nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.
Leviticus||20||18||And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath made naked her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.
Leviticus||20||19||And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mothers sister, nor of thy fathers sister; for he hath made naked his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity.
Leviticus||20||20||And if a man shall lie with his uncles wife, he hath uncovered his uncles nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.
Leviticus||20||21||And if a man shall take his brothers wife, it is impurity: he hath uncovered his brothers nakedness; they shall be childless.
Leviticus||20||22||Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all mine ordinances, and do them; that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, vomit you not out.
Leviticus||20||23||And ye shall not walk in the customs of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they did all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.
Leviticus||20||24||But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey: I am Jehovah your God, who hath separated you from the peoples.
Leviticus||20||25||Ye shall therefore make a distinction between the clean beast and the unclean, and between the unclean fowl and the clean: and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by bird, or by anything wherewith the ground teemeth, which I have separated from you as unclean.
Leviticus||20||26||And ye shall be holy unto me: for I, Jehovah, am holy, and have set you apart from the peoples, that ye should be mine.
Leviticus||20||27||A man also or a woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones; their blood shall be upon them.
Leviticus||21||1||And Jehovah said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say unto them, There shall none defile himself for the dead among his people;
Leviticus||21||2||except for his kin, that is near unto him, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother,
Leviticus||21||3||and for his sister a virgin, that is near unto him, that hath had no husband; for her may he defile himself.
Leviticus||21||4||He shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself.
Leviticus||21||5||They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh.
Leviticus||21||6||They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God; for the offerings of Jehovah made by fire, the bread of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy.
Leviticus||21||7||They shall not take a woman that is a harlot, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy unto his God.
Leviticus||21||8||Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I Jehovah, who sanctify you, am holy.
Leviticus||21||9||And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the harlot, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire.
Leviticus||21||10||And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil is poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not let the hair of his head go loose, nor rend his clothes;
Leviticus||21||11||neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother;
Leviticus||21||12||neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus||21||13||And he shall take a wife in her virginity.
Leviticus||21||14||A widow, or one divorced, or a profane woman, a harlot, these shall he not take: but a virgin of his own people shall he take to wife.
Leviticus||21||15||And he shall not profane his seed among his people: for I am Jehovah who sanctifieth him.
Leviticus||21||16||And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus||21||17||Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed throughout their generations that hath a blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God.
Leviticus||21||18||For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or anything superfluous,
Leviticus||21||19||or a man that is broken-footed, or broken-handed,
Leviticus||21||20||or crook-backed, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or is scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;
Leviticus||21||21||no man of the seed of Aaron the priest, that hath a blemish, shall come nigh to offer the offerings of Jehovah made by fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.
Leviticus||21||22||He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy:
Leviticus||21||23||only he shall not go in unto the veil, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I am Jehovah who sanctifieth them.
Leviticus||21||24||So Moses spake unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel.
Leviticus||22||1||And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus||22||2||Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, which they hallow unto me, and that they profane not my holy name: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus||22||3||Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed throughout your generations, that approacheth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto Jehovah, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from before me: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus||22||4||What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath an issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso toucheth anything that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;
Leviticus||22||5||or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath;
Leviticus||22||6||the soul that toucheth any such shall be unclean until the even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his flesh in water.
Leviticus||22||7||And when the sun is down, he shall be clean; and afterward he shall eat of the holy things, because it is his bread.
Leviticus||22||8||That which dieth of itself, or is torn of beasts, he shall not eat, to defile himself therewith: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus||22||9||They shall therefore keep my charge, lest they bear sin for it, and die therein, if they profane it: I am Jehovah who sanctifieth them.
Leviticus||22||10||There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priests, or a hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.
Leviticus||22||11||But if a priest buy any soul, the purchase of his money, he shall eat of it; and such as are born in his house, they shall eat of his bread.
Leviticus||22||12||And if a priests daughter be married unto a stranger, she shall not eat of the heave-offering of the holy things.
Leviticus||22||13||But if a priests daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and be returned unto her fathers house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her fathers bread: but there shall no stranger eat thereof.
Leviticus||22||14||And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give unto the priest the holy thing.
Leviticus||22||15||And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto Jehovah,
Leviticus||22||16||and so cause them to bear the iniquity that bringeth guilt, when they eat their holy things: for I am Jehovah who sanctifieth them.
Leviticus||22||17||And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus||22||18||Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whosoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the sojourners in Israel, that offereth his oblation, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their freewill-offerings, which they offer unto Jehovah for a burnt-offering;
Leviticus||22||19||that ye may be accepted, ye shall offer a male without blemish, of the bullocks, of the sheep, or of the goats.
Leviticus||22||20||But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you.
Leviticus||22||21||And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto Jehovah to accomplish a vow, or for a freewill-offering, of the herd or of the flock, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.
Leviticus||22||22||Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto Jehovah, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto Jehovah.
Leviticus||22||23||Either a bullock or a lamb that hath anything superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill-offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.
Leviticus||22||24||That which hath its stones bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut, ye shall not offer unto Jehovah; neither shall ye do thus in your land.
Leviticus||22||25||Neither from the hand of a foreigner shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, there is a blemish in them: they shall not be accepted for you.
Leviticus||22||26||And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus||22||27||When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for the oblation of an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Leviticus||22||28||And whether it be cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and its young both in one day.
Leviticus||22||29||And when ye sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto Jehovah, ye shall sacrifice it that ye may be accepted.
Leviticus||22||30||On the same day it shall be eaten; ye shall leave none of it until the morning: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus||22||31||Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus||22||32||And ye shall not profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am Jehovah who halloweth you,
Leviticus||22||33||who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus||23||1||And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus||23||2||Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, The set feasts of Jehovah, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my set feasts.
Leviticus||23||3||Six days shall work be done: but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of work: it is a sabbath unto Jehovah in all your dwellings.
Leviticus||23||4||These are the set feasts of Jehovah, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their appointed season.
Leviticus||23||5||In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, is Jehovahs passover.
Leviticus||23||6||And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto Jehovah: seven days ye shall eat unleavened bread.
Leviticus||23||7||In the first day ye shall have a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work.
Leviticus||23||8||But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah seven days: in the seventh day is a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work.
Leviticus||23||9||And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus||23||10||Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring the sheaf of the first-fruits of your harvest unto the priest:
Leviticus||23||11||and he shall wave the sheaf before Jehovah, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.
Leviticus||23||12||And in the day when ye wave the sheaf, ye shall offer a he-lamb without blemish a year old for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah.
Leviticus||23||13||And the meal-offering thereof shall be two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah for a sweet savor; and the drink-offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of a hin.
Leviticus||23||14||And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched grain, nor fresh ears, until this selfsame day, until ye have brought the oblation of your God: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
Leviticus||23||15||And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave-offering; seven sabbaths shall there be complete:
Leviticus||23||16||even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meal-offering unto Jehovah.
Leviticus||23||17||Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave-loaves of two tenth parts of an ephah: they shall be of fine flour, they shall be baken with leaven, for first-fruits unto Jehovah.
Leviticus||23||18||And ye shall present with the bread seven lambs without blemish a year old, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be a burnt-offering unto Jehovah, with their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings, even an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.
Leviticus||23||19||And ye shall offer one he-goat for a sin-offering, and two he-lambs a year old for a sacrifice of peace-offerings.
Leviticus||23||20||And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first-fruits for a wave-offering before Jehovah, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to Jehovah for the priest.
Leviticus||23||21||And ye shall make proclamation on the selfsame day; there shall be a holy convocation unto you; ye shall do no servile work: it is a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.
Leviticus||23||22||And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them for the poor, and for the sojourner: I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus||23||23||And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus||23||24||Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, shall be a solemn rest unto you, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation.
Leviticus||23||25||Ye shall do no servile work; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Leviticus||23||26||And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus||23||27||Howbeit on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement: it shall be a holy convocation unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Leviticus||23||28||And ye shall do no manner of work in that same day; for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you before Jehovah your God.
Leviticus||23||29||For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day; he shall be cut off from his people.
Leviticus||23||30||And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any manner of work in that same day, that soul will I destroy from among his people.
Leviticus||23||31||Ye shall do no manner of work: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
Leviticus||23||32||It shall be unto you a sabbath of solemn rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye keep your sabbath.
Leviticus||23||33||And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus||23||34||Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto Jehovah.
Leviticus||23||35||On the first day shall be a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work.
Leviticus||23||36||Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah: on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah: it is a solemn assembly; ye shall do no servile work.
Leviticus||23||37||These are the set feasts of Jehovah, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah, a burnt-offering, and a meal-offering, a sacrifice, and drink-offerings, each on its own day;
Leviticus||23||38||besides the sabbaths o Jehovah, and besides your gifts, and besides all your vows, and besides all your freewill-offerings, which ye give unto Jehovah.
Leviticus||23||39||Howbeit on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruits of the land, ye shall keep the feast of Jehovah seven days: on the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest.
Leviticus||23||40||And ye shall take you on the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm-trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before Jehovah your God seven days.
Leviticus||23||41||And ye shall keep it a feast unto Jehovah seven days in the year: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations; ye shall keep it in the seventh month.
Leviticus||23||42||Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are home-born in Israel shall dwell in booths;
Leviticus||23||43||that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus||23||44||And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the set feasts of Jehovah.
Leviticus||24||1||And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus||24||2||Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually.
Leviticus||24||3||Without the veil of the testimony, in the tent of meeting, shall Aaron keep it in order from evening to morning before Jehovah continually: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations.
Leviticus||24||4||He shall keep in order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before Jehovah continually.
Leviticus||24||5||And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth parts of an ephah shall be in one cake.
Leviticus||24||6||And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before Jehovah.
Leviticus||24||7||And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be to the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
Leviticus||24||8||Every sabbath day he shall set it in order before Jehovah continually; it is on the behalf of the children of Israel, an everlasting covenant.
Leviticus||24||9||And it shall be for Aaron and his sons; and they shall eat it in a holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire by a perpetual statute.
Leviticus||24||10||And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and the son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp:
Leviticus||24||11||and the son of the Israelitish woman blasphemed the Name, and cursed; and they brought him unto Moses. And his mothers name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.
Leviticus||24||12||And they put him in ward, that it might be declared unto them at the mouth of Jehovah.
Leviticus||24||13||And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus||24||14||Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.
Leviticus||24||15||And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.
Leviticus||24||16||And he that blasphemeth the name of Jehovah, he shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the sojourner, as the home-born, when he blasphemeth the name of Jehovah, shall be put to death.
Leviticus||24||17||And he that smiteth any man mortally shall surely be put to death.
Leviticus||24||18||And he that smiteth a beast mortally shall make it good, life for life.
Leviticus||24||19||And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbor; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him:
Leviticus||24||20||breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be rendered unto him.
Leviticus||24||21||And he that killeth a beast shall make it good: and he that killeth a man shall be put to death.
Leviticus||24||22||Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the sojourner, as for the home-born: for I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus||24||23||And Moses spake to the children of Israel; and they brought forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones. And the children of Israel did as Jehovah commanded Moses.
Leviticus||25||1||And Jehovah spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,
Leviticus||25||2||Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto Jehovah.
Leviticus||25||3||Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruits thereof;
Leviticus||25||4||but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land, a sabbath unto Jehovah: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.
Leviticus||25||5||That which groweth of itself of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, and the grapes of thy undressed vine thou shalt not gather: it shall be a year of solemn rest for the land.
Leviticus||25||6||And the sabbath of the land shall be for food for you; for thee, and for thy servant and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant and for thy stranger, who sojourn with thee.
Leviticus||25||7||And for thy cattle, and for the beasts that are in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be for food.
Leviticus||25||8||And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and there shall be unto thee the days of seven sabbaths of years, even forty and nine years.
Leviticus||25||9||Then shalt thou send abroad the loud trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month; in the day of atonement shall ye send abroad the trumpet throughout all your land.
Leviticus||25||10||And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.
Leviticus||25||11||A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of the undressed vines.
Leviticus||25||12||For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.
Leviticus||25||13||In this year of jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession.
Leviticus||25||14||And if thou sell aught unto thy neighbor, or buy of thy neighbors hand, ye shall not wrong one another.
Leviticus||25||15||According to the number of years after the jubilee thou shalt buy of thy neighbor, and according unto the number of years of the crops he shall sell unto thee.
Leviticus||25||16||According to the multitude of the years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of the years thou shalt diminish the price of it; for the number of the crops doth he sell unto thee.
Leviticus||25||17||And ye shall not wrong one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus||25||18||Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep mine ordinances and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.
Leviticus||25||19||And the land shall yield its fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.
Leviticus||25||20||And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? Behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase;
Leviticus||25||21||then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for the three years.
Leviticus||25||22||And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat of the fruits, the old store; until the ninth year, until its fruits come in, ye shall eat the old store.
Leviticus||25||23||And the land shall not be sold in perpetuity; for the land is mine: for ye are strangers and sojourners with me.
Leviticus||25||24||And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.
Leviticus||25||25||If thy brother be waxed poor, and sell some of his possession, then shall his kinsman that is next unto him come, and shall redeem that which his brother hath sold.
Leviticus||25||26||And if a man have no one to redeem it, and he be waxed rich and find sufficient to redeem it;
Leviticus||25||27||then let him reckon the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; and he shall return unto his possession.
Leviticus||25||28||But if he be not able to get it back for himself, then that which he hath sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubilee: and in the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.
Leviticus||25||29||And if a man sell a dwelling-house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; for a full year shall he have the right of redemption.
Leviticus||25||30||And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be made sure in perpetuity to him that bought it, throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubilee.
Leviticus||25||31||But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be reckoned with the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee.
Leviticus||25||32||Nevertheless the cities of the Levites, the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.
Leviticus||25||33||And if one of the Levites redeem, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.
Leviticus||25||34||But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.
Leviticus||25||35||And if thy brother be waxed poor, and his hand fail with thee; then thou shalt uphold him: as a stranger and a sojourner shall he live with thee.
Leviticus||25||36||Take thou no interest of him or increase, but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee.
Leviticus||25||37||Thou shalt not give him thy money upon interest, nor give him thy victuals for increase.
Leviticus||25||38||I am Jehovah your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.
Leviticus||25||39||And if thy brother be waxed poor with thee, and sell himself unto thee; thou shalt not make him to serve as a bond-servant.
Leviticus||25||40||As a hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with thee; he shall serve with thee unto the year of jubilee:
Leviticus||25||41||then shall he go out from thee, he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return.
Leviticus||25||42||For they are my servants, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.
Leviticus||25||43||Thou shalt not rule over him with rigor, but shalt fear thy God.
Leviticus||25||44||And as for thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, whom thou shalt have; of the nations that are round about you, of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.
Leviticus||25||45||Moreover of the children of the strangers that sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they have begotten in your land: and they shall be your possession.
Leviticus||25||46||And ye shall make them an inheritance for your children after you, to hold for a possession; of them shall ye take your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel ye shall not rule, one over another, with rigor.
Leviticus||25||47||And if a stranger or sojourner with thee be waxed rich, and thy brother be waxed poor beside him, and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner with thee, or to the stock of the strangers family;
Leviticus||25||48||after that he is sold he may be redeemed: one of his brethren may redeem him;
Leviticus||25||49||or his uncle, or his uncles son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be waxed rich, he may redeem himself.
Leviticus||25||50||And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he sold himself to him unto the year of jubilee: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years; according to the time of a hired servant shall he be with him.
Leviticus||25||51||If there be yet many years, according unto them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.
Leviticus||25||52||And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubilee, then he shall reckon with him; according unto his years shall he give back the price of his redemption.
Leviticus||25||53||As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him: he shall not rule with rigor over him in thy sight.
Leviticus||25||54||And if he be not redeemed by these means, then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, he, and his children with him.
Leviticus||25||55||For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus||26||1||Ye shall make you no idols, neither shall ye rear you up a graven image, or a pillar, neither shall ye place any figured stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am Jehovah your God.
Leviticus||26||2||Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus||26||3||If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;
Leviticus||26||4||then I will give your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.
Leviticus||26||5||And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time; and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.
Leviticus||26||6||And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.
Leviticus||26||7||And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.
Leviticus||26||8||And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.
Leviticus||26||9||And I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and will establish my covenant with you.
Leviticus||26||10||And ye shall eat old store long kept, and ye shall bring forth the old because of the new.
Leviticus||26||11||And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.
Leviticus||26||12||And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.
Leviticus||26||13||I am Jehovah your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bars of your yoke, and made you go upright.
Leviticus||26||14||But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;
Leviticus||26||15||and if ye shall reject my statutes, and if your soul abhor mine ordinances, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but break my covenant;
Leviticus||26||16||I also will do this unto you: I will appoint terror over you, even consumption and fever, that shall consume the eyes, and make the soul to pine away; and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.
Leviticus||26||17||And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be smitten before your enemies: they that hate you shall rule over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.
Leviticus||26||18||And if ye will not yet for these things hearken unto me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins.
Leviticus||26||19||And I will break the pride of your power: and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass;
Leviticus||26||20||and your strength shall be spent in vain; for your land shall not yield its increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruit.
Leviticus||26||21||And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me, I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.
Leviticus||26||22||And I will send the beast of the field among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your ways shall become desolate.
Leviticus||26||23||And if by these things ye will not be reformed unto me, but will walk contrary unto me;
Leviticus||26||24||then will I also walk contrary unto you; and I will smite you, even I, seven times for your sins.
Leviticus||26||25||And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant; and ye shall be gathered together within your cities: and I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.
Leviticus||26||26||When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.
Leviticus||26||27||And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;
Leviticus||26||28||then I will walk contrary unto you in wrath; and I also will chastise you seven times for your sins.
Leviticus||26||29||And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.
Leviticus||26||30||And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your sun-images, and cast your dead bodies upon the bodies of your idols; and my soul shall abhor you.
Leviticus||26||31||And I will make your cities a waste, and will bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors.
Leviticus||26||32||And I will bring the land into desolation; and your enemies that dwell therein shall be astonished at it.
Leviticus||26||33||And you will I scatter among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you: and your land shall be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste.
Leviticus||26||34||Then shall the land enjoy its sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye are in your enemies land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy its sabbaths.
Leviticus||26||35||As long as it lieth desolate it shall have rest, even the rest which it had not in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.
Leviticus||26||36||And as for them that are left of you, I will send a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies: and the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as one fleeth from the sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.
Leviticus||26||37||And they shall stumble one upon another, as it were before the sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.
Leviticus||26||38||And ye shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.
Leviticus||26||39||And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.
Leviticus||26||40||And they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that, because they walked contrary unto me,
Leviticus||26||41||I also walked contrary unto them, and brought them into the land of their enemies: if then their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity;
Leviticus||26||42||then will I remember my covenant with Jacob; and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.
Leviticus||26||43||The land also shall be left by them, and shall enjoy its sabbaths, while it lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they rejected mine ordinances, and their soul abhorred my statutes.
Leviticus||26||44||And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them; for I am Jehovah their God;
Leviticus||26||45||but I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am Jehovah.
Leviticus||26||46||These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which Jehovah made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by Moses.
Leviticus||27||1||And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
Leviticus||27||2||Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall accomplish a vow, the persons shall be for Jehovah by thy estimation.
Leviticus||27||3||And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.
Leviticus||27||4||And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.
Leviticus||27||5||And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
Leviticus||27||6||And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.
Leviticus||27||7||And if it be from sixty years old and upward; if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
Leviticus||27||8||But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the ability of him that vowed shall the priest value him.
Leviticus||27||9||And if it be a beast, whereof men offer an oblation unto Jehovah, all that any man giveth of such unto Jehovah shall be holy.
Leviticus||27||10||He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy.
Leviticus||27||11||And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer an oblation unto Jehovah, then he shall set the beast before the priest;
Leviticus||27||12||and the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou the priest valuest it, so shall it be.
Leviticus||27||13||But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part thereof unto thy estimation.
Leviticus||27||14||And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto Jehovah, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.
Leviticus||27||15||And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his.
Leviticus||27||16||And if a man shall sanctify unto Jehovah part of the field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the sowing thereof: the sowing of a homer of barley shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.
Leviticus||27||17||If he sanctify his field from the year of jubilee, according to thy estimation it shall stand.
Leviticus||27||18||But if he sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain unto the year of jubilee; and an abatement shall be made from thy estimation.
Leviticus||27||19||And if he that sanctified the field will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.
Leviticus||27||20||And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more:
Leviticus||27||21||but the field, when it goeth out in the jubilee, shall be holy unto Jehovah, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priests.
Leviticus||27||22||And if he sanctify unto Jehovah a field which he hath bought, which is not of the field of his possession;
Leviticus||27||23||then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation unto the year of jubilee: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto Jehovah.
Leviticus||27||24||In the year of jubilee the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belongeth.
Leviticus||27||25||And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.
Leviticus||27||26||Only the firstling among beasts, which is made a firstling to Jehovah, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox or sheep, it is Jehovahs.
Leviticus||27||27||And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall ransom it according to thine estimation, and shall add unto it the fifth part thereof: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.
Leviticus||27||28||Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto Jehovah of all that he hath, whether of man or beast, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto Jehovah.
Leviticus||27||29||No one devoted, that shall be devoted from among men, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death.
Leviticus||27||30||And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is Jehovahs: it is holy unto Jehovah.
Leviticus||27||31||And if a man will redeem aught of his tithe, he shall add unto it the fifth part thereof.
Leviticus||27||32||And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto Jehovah.
Leviticus||27||33||He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.
Leviticus||27||34||These are the commandments, which Jehovah commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.
