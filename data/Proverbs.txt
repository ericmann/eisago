Proverbs||1||1||The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel:
Proverbs||1||2||To know wisdom and instruction; To discern the words of understanding;
Proverbs||1||3||To receive instruction in wise dealing, In righteousness and justice and equity;
Proverbs||1||4||To give prudence to the simple, To the young man knowledge and discretion:
Proverbs||1||5||That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning; And that the man of understanding may attain unto sound counsels:
Proverbs||1||6||To understand a proverb, and a figure, The words of the wise, and their dark sayings.
Proverbs||1||7||The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge; But the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.
Proverbs||1||8||My son, hear the instruction of thy father, And forsake not the law of thy mother:
Proverbs||1||9||For they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head, And chains about thy neck.
Proverbs||1||10||My son, if sinners entice thee, Consent thou not.
Proverbs||1||11||If they say, Come with us, Let us lay wait for blood; Let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause;
Proverbs||1||12||Let us swallow them up alive as Sheol, And whole, as those that go down into the pit;
Proverbs||1||13||We shall find all precious substance; We shall fill our houses with spoil;
Proverbs||1||14||Thou shalt cast thy lot among us; We will all have one purse:
Proverbs||1||15||My son, walk not thou in the way with them; Refrain thy foot from their path:
Proverbs||1||16||For their feet run to evil, And they make haste to shed blood.
Proverbs||1||17||For in vain is the net spread In the sight of any bird:
Proverbs||1||18||And these lay wait for their own blood; They lurk privily for their own lives.
Proverbs||1||19||So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; It taketh away the life of the owners thereof.
Proverbs||1||20||Wisdom crieth aloud in the street; She uttereth her voice in the broad places;
Proverbs||1||21||She crieth in the chief place of concourse; At the entrance of the gates, In the city, she uttereth her words:
Proverbs||1||22||How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? And scoffers delight them in scoffing, And fools hate knowledge?
Proverbs||1||23||Turn you at my reproof: Behold, I will pour out my spirit upon you; I will make known my words unto you.
Proverbs||1||24||Because I have called, and ye have refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man hath regarded;
Proverbs||1||25||But ye have set at nought all my counsel, And would none of my reproof:
Proverbs||1||26||I also will laugh in the day of your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;
Proverbs||1||27||When your fear cometh as a storm, And your calamity cometh on as a whirlwind; When distress and anguish come upon you.
Proverbs||1||28||Then will they call upon me, but I will not answer; They will seek me diligently, but they shall not find me:
Proverbs||1||29||For that they hated knowledge, And did not choose the fear of Jehovah:
Proverbs||1||30||They would none of my counsel; They despised all my reproof.
Proverbs||1||31||Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, And be filled with their own devices.
Proverbs||1||32||For the backsliding of the simple shall slay them, And the careless ease of fools shall destroy them.
Proverbs||1||33||But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell securely, And shall be quiet without fear of evil.
Proverbs||2||1||My son, if thou wilt receive my words, And lay up my commandments with thee;
Proverbs||2||2||So as to incline thine ear unto wisdom, And apply thy heart to understanding;
Proverbs||2||3||Yea, if thou cry after discernment, And lift up thy voice for understanding;
Proverbs||2||4||If thou seek her as silver, And search for her as for hid treasures:
Proverbs||2||5||Then shalt thou understand the fear of Jehovah, And find the knowledge of God.
Proverbs||2||6||For Jehovah giveth wisdom; Out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding:
Proverbs||2||7||He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright; He is a shield to them that walk in integrity;
Proverbs||2||8||That he may guard the paths of justice, And preserve the way of his saints.
Proverbs||2||9||Then shalt thou understand righteousness and justice, And equity, yea, every good path.
Proverbs||2||10||For wisdom shall enter into thy heart, And knowledge shall be pleasant unto thy soul;
Proverbs||2||11||Discretion shall watch over thee; Understanding shall keep thee:
Proverbs||2||12||To deliver thee from the way of evil, From the men that speak perverse things;
Proverbs||2||13||Who forsake the paths of uprightness, To walk in the ways of darkness;
Proverbs||2||14||Who rejoice to do evil, And delight in the perverseness of evil;
Proverbs||2||15||Who are crooked in their ways, And wayward in their paths:
Proverbs||2||16||To deliver thee from the strange woman, Even from the foreigner that flattereth with her words;
Proverbs||2||17||That forsaketh the friend of her youth, And forgetteth the covenant of her God:
Proverbs||2||18||For her house inclineth unto death, And her paths unto the dead;
Proverbs||2||19||None that go unto her return again, Neither do they attain unto the paths of life:
Proverbs||2||20||That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, And keep the paths of the righteous.
Proverbs||2||21||For the upright shall dwell in the land, And the perfect shall remain in it.
Proverbs||2||22||But the wicked shall be cut off from the land, And the treacherous shall be rooted out of it.
Proverbs||3||1||My son, forget not my law; But let thy heart keep my commandments:
Proverbs||3||2||For length of days, and years of life, And peace, will they add to thee.
Proverbs||3||3||Let not kindness and truth forsake thee: Bind them about thy neck; Write them upon the tablet of thy heart:
Proverbs||3||4||So shalt thou find favor and good understanding In the sight of God and man.
Proverbs||3||5||Trust in Jehovah with all thy heart, And lean not upon thine own understanding:
Proverbs||3||6||In all thy ways acknowledge him, And he will direct thy paths.
Proverbs||3||7||Be not wise in thine own eyes; Fear Jehovah, and depart from evil:
Proverbs||3||8||It will be health to thy navel, And marrow to thy bones.
Proverbs||3||9||Honor Jehovah with thy substance, And with the first-fruits of all thine increase:
Proverbs||3||10||So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, And thy vats shall overflow with new wine.
Proverbs||3||11||My son, despise not the chastening of Jehovah; Neither be weary of his reproof:
Proverbs||3||12||For whom Jehovah loveth he reproveth; Even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.
Proverbs||3||13||Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, And the man that getteth understanding.
Proverbs||3||14||For the gaining of it is better than the gaining of silver, And the profit thereof than fine gold.
Proverbs||3||15||She is more precious than rubies: And none of the things thou canst desire are to be compared unto her.
Proverbs||3||16||Length of days is in her right hand; In her left hand are riches and honor.
Proverbs||3||17||Her ways are ways of pleasantness, And all her paths are peace.
Proverbs||3||18||She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: And happy is every one that retaineth her.
Proverbs||3||19||Jehovah by wisdom founded the earth; By understanding he established the heavens.
Proverbs||3||20||By his knowledge the depths were broken up, And the skies drop down the dew.
Proverbs||3||21||My son, let them not depart from thine eyes; Keep sound wisdom and discretion:
Proverbs||3||22||So shall they be life unto thy soul, And grace to thy neck.
Proverbs||3||23||Then shalt thou walk in thy way securely, And thy foot shall not stumble.
Proverbs||3||24||When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: Yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.
Proverbs||3||25||Be not afraid of sudden fear, Neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh:
Proverbs||3||26||For Jehovah will be thy confidence, And will keep thy foot from being taken.
Proverbs||3||27||Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, When it is in the power of thy hand to do it.
Proverbs||3||28||Say not unto thy neighbor, Go, and come again, And to-morrow I will give; When thou hast it by thee.
Proverbs||3||29||Devise not evil against thy neighbor, Seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.
Proverbs||3||30||Strive not with a man without cause, If he have done thee no harm.
Proverbs||3||31||Envy thou not the man of violence, And choose none of his ways.
Proverbs||3||32||For the perverse is an abomination to Jehovah; But his friendship is with the upright.
Proverbs||3||33||The curse of Jehovah is in the house of the wicked; But he blesseth the habitation of the righteous.
Proverbs||3||34||Surely he scoffeth at the scoffers; But he giveth grace unto the lowly.
Proverbs||3||35||The wise shall inherit glory; But shame shall be the promotion of fools.
Proverbs||4||1||Hear, my sons, the instruction of a father, And attend to know understanding:
Proverbs||4||2||For I give you good doctrine; Forsake ye not my law.
Proverbs||4||3||For I was a son unto my father, Tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.
Proverbs||4||4||And he taught me, and said unto me: Let thy heart retain my words; Keep my commandments, and live;
Proverbs||4||5||Get wisdom, get understanding; Forget not, neither decline from the words of my mouth;
Proverbs||4||6||Forsake her not, and she will preserve thee; Love her, and she will keep thee.
Proverbs||4||7||Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom; Yea, with all thy getting get understanding.
Proverbs||4||8||Exalt her, and she will promote thee; She will bring thee to honor, when thou dost embrace her.
Proverbs||4||9||She will give to thy head a chaplet of grace; A crown of beauty will she deliver to thee.
Proverbs||4||10||Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; And the years of thy life shall be many.
Proverbs||4||11||I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in paths of uprightness.
Proverbs||4||12||When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; And if thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.
Proverbs||4||13||Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: Keep her; for she is thy life.
Proverbs||4||14||Enter not into the path of the wicked, And walk not in the way of evil men.
Proverbs||4||15||Avoid it, pass not by it; Turn from it, and pass on.
Proverbs||4||16||For they sleep not, except they do evil; And their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.
Proverbs||4||17||For they eat the bread of wickedness, And drink the wine of violence.
Proverbs||4||18||But the path of the righteous is as the dawning light, That shineth more and more unto the perfect day.
Proverbs||4||19||The way of the wicked is as darkness: They know not at what they stumble.
Proverbs||4||20||My son, attend to my words; Incline thine ear unto my sayings.
Proverbs||4||21||Let them not depart from thine eyes; Keep them in the midst of thy heart.
Proverbs||4||22||For they are life unto those that find them, And health to all their flesh.
Proverbs||4||23||Keep thy heart with all diligence; For out of it are the issues of life.
Proverbs||4||24||Put away from thee a wayward mouth, And perverse lips put far from thee.
Proverbs||4||25||Let thine eyes look right on, And let thine eyelids look straight before thee.
Proverbs||4||26||Make level the path of thy feet, And let all thy ways be established.
Proverbs||4||27||Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: Remove thy foot from evil.
Proverbs||5||1||My son, attend unto my wisdom; Incline thine ear to my understanding:
Proverbs||5||2||That thou mayest preserve discretion, And that thy lips may keep knowledge.
Proverbs||5||3||For the lips of a strange woman drop honey, And her mouth is smoother than oil:
Proverbs||5||4||But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a two-edged sword.
Proverbs||5||5||Her feet go down to death; Her steps take hold on Sheol;
Proverbs||5||6||So that she findeth not the level path of life: Her ways are unstable, and she knoweth it not.
Proverbs||5||7||Now therefore, my sons, hearken unto me, And depart not from the words of my mouth.
Proverbs||5||8||Remove thy way far from her, And come not nigh the door of her house;
Proverbs||5||9||Lest thou give thine honor unto others, And thy years unto the cruel;
Proverbs||5||10||Lest strangers be filled with thy strength, And thy labors be in the house of an alien,
Proverbs||5||11||And thou mourn at thy latter end, When thy flesh and thy body are consumed,
Proverbs||5||12||And say, How have I hated instruction, And my heart despised reproof;
Proverbs||5||13||Neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers, Nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!
Proverbs||5||14||I was well-nigh in all evil In the midst of the assembly and congregation.
Proverbs||5||15||Drink waters out of thine own cistern, And running waters out of thine own well.
Proverbs||5||16||Should thy springs be dispersed abroad, And streams of water in the streets?
Proverbs||5||17||Let them be for thyself alone, And not for strangers with thee.
Proverbs||5||18||Let thy fountain be blessed; And rejoice in the wife of thy youth.
Proverbs||5||19||As a loving hind and a pleasant doe, Let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; And be thou ravished always with her love.
Proverbs||5||20||For why shouldest thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, And embrace the bosom of a foreigner?
Proverbs||5||21||For the ways of man are before the eyes of Jehovah; And he maketh level all his paths.
Proverbs||5||22||His own iniquities shall take the wicked, And he shall be holden with the cords of his sin.
Proverbs||5||23||He shall die for lack of instruction; And in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
Proverbs||6||1||My son, if thou art become surety for thy neighbor, If thou hast stricken thy hands for a stranger;
Proverbs||6||2||Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, Thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.
Proverbs||6||3||Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, Seeing thou art come into the hand of thy neighbor: Go, humble thyself, and importune thy neighbor;
Proverbs||6||4||Give not sleep to thine eyes, Nor slumber to thine eyelids;
Proverbs||6||5||Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, And as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
Proverbs||6||6||Go to the ant, thou sluggard; Consider her ways, and be wise:
Proverbs||6||7||Which having no chief, Overseer, or ruler,
Proverbs||6||8||Provideth her bread in the summer, And gathereth her food in the harvest.
Proverbs||6||9||How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?
Proverbs||6||10||Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to sleep:
Proverbs||6||11||So shall thy poverty come as a robber, And thy want as an armed man.
Proverbs||6||12||A worthless person, a man of iniquity, Is he that walketh with a perverse mouth;
Proverbs||6||13||That winketh with his eyes, that speaketh with his feet, That maketh signs with his fingers;
Proverbs||6||14||In whose heart is perverseness, Who deviseth evil continually, Who soweth discord.
Proverbs||6||15||Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; On a sudden shall he be broken, and that without remedy.
Proverbs||6||16||There are six things which Jehovah hateth; Yea, seven which are an abomination unto him:
Proverbs||6||17||Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, And hands that shed innocent blood;
Proverbs||6||18||A heart that deviseth wicked purposes, Feet that are swift in running to mischief,
Proverbs||6||19||A false witness that uttereth lies, And he that soweth discord among brethren.
Proverbs||6||20||My son, keep the commandment of thy father, And forsake not the law of thy mother:
Proverbs||6||21||Bind them continually upon thy heart; Tie them about thy neck.
Proverbs||6||22||When thou walkest, it shall lead thee; When thou sleepest, it shall watch over thee; And when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.
Proverbs||6||23||For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; And reproofs of instruction are the way of life:
Proverbs||6||24||To keep thee from the evil woman, From the flattery of the foreigners tongue.
Proverbs||6||25||Lust not after her beauty in thy heart; Neither let her take thee with her eyelids.
Proverbs||6||26||For on account of a harlot a man is brought to a piece of bread; And the adulteress hunteth for the precious life.
Proverbs||6||27||Can a man take fire in his bosom, And his clothes not be burned?
Proverbs||6||28||Or can one walk upon hot coals, And his feet not be scorched?
Proverbs||6||29||So he that goeth in to his neighbors wife; Whosoever toucheth her shall not be unpunished.
Proverbs||6||30||Men do not despise a thief, if he steal To satisfy himself when he is hungry:
Proverbs||6||31||But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; He shall give all the substance of his house.
Proverbs||6||32||He that committeth adultery with a woman is void of understanding: He doeth it who would destroy his own soul.
Proverbs||6||33||Wounds and dishonor shall he get; And his reproach shall not be wiped away.
Proverbs||6||34||For jealousy is the rage of a man; And he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
Proverbs||6||35||He will not regard any ransom; Neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.
Proverbs||7||1||My son, keep my words, And lay up my commandments with thee.
Proverbs||7||2||Keep my commandments and live; And my law as the apple of thine eye.
Proverbs||7||3||Bind them upon thy fingers; Write them upon the tablet of thy heart.
Proverbs||7||4||Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; And call understanding thy kinswoman:
Proverbs||7||5||That they may keep thee from the strange woman, From the foreigner that flattereth with her words.
Proverbs||7||6||For at the window of my house I looked forth through my lattice;
Proverbs||7||7||And I beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, A young man void of understanding,
Proverbs||7||8||Passing through the street near her corner; And he went the way to her house,
Proverbs||7||9||In the twilight, in the evening of the day, In the middle of the night and in the darkness.
Proverbs||7||10||And, behold, there met him a woman With the attire of a harlot, and wily of heart.
Proverbs||7||11||She is clamorous and wilful; Her feet abide not in her house:
Proverbs||7||12||Now she is in the streets, now in the broad places, And lieth in wait at every corner.
Proverbs||7||13||So she caught him, and kissed him, And with an impudent face she said unto him:
Proverbs||7||14||Sacrifices of peace-offerings are with me; This day have I paid my vows.
Proverbs||7||15||Therefore came I forth to meet thee, Diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.
Proverbs||7||16||I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry, With striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.
Proverbs||7||17||I have perfumed my bed With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
Proverbs||7||18||Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning; Let us solace ourselves with loves.
Proverbs||7||19||For the man is not at home; He is gone a long journey:
Proverbs||7||20||He hath taken a bag of money with him; He will come home at the full moon.
Proverbs||7||21||With her much fair speech she causeth him to yield; With the flattering of her lips she forceth him along.
Proverbs||7||22||He goeth after her straightway, As an ox goeth to the slaughter, Or as one in fetters to the correction of the fool;
Proverbs||7||23||Till an arrow strike through his liver; As a bird hasteth to the snare, And knoweth not that it is for his life.
Proverbs||7||24||Now therefore, my sons, hearken unto me, And attend to the words of my mouth.
Proverbs||7||25||Let not thy heart decline to her ways; Go not astray in her paths.
Proverbs||7||26||For she hath cast down many wounded: Yea, all her slain are a mighty host.
Proverbs||7||27||Her house is the way to Sheol, Going down to the chambers of death.
Proverbs||8||1||Doth not wisdom cry, And understanding put forth her voice?
Proverbs||8||2||On the top of high places by the way, Where the paths meet, she standeth;
Proverbs||8||3||Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, At the coming in at the doors, she crieth aloud:
Proverbs||8||4||Unto you, O men, I call; And my voice is to the sons of men.
Proverbs||8||5||O ye simple, understand prudence; And, ye fools, be of an understanding heart.
Proverbs||8||6||Hear, for I will speak excellent things; And the opening of my lips shall be right things.
Proverbs||8||7||For my mouth shall utter truth; And wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
Proverbs||8||8||All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.
Proverbs||8||9||They are all plain to him that understandeth, And right to them that find knowledge.
Proverbs||8||10||Receive my instruction, and not silver; And knowledge rather than choice gold.
Proverbs||8||11||For wisdom is better than rubies; And all the things that may be desired are not to be compared unto it.
Proverbs||8||12||I wisdom have made prudence my dwelling, And find out knowledge and discretion.
Proverbs||8||13||The fear of Jehovah is to hate evil: Pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, And the perverse mouth, do I hate.
Proverbs||8||14||Counsel is mine, and sound knowledge: I am understanding; I have might.
Proverbs||8||15||By me kings reign, And princes decree justice.
Proverbs||8||16||By me princes rule, And nobles, even all the judges of the earth.
Proverbs||8||17||I love them that love me; And those that seek me diligently shall find me.
Proverbs||8||18||Riches and honor are with me; Yea, durable wealth and righteousness.
Proverbs||8||19||My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; And my revenue than choice silver.
Proverbs||8||20||I walk in the way of righteousness, In the midst of the paths of justice;
Proverbs||8||21||That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance, And that I may fill their treasuries.
Proverbs||8||22||Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of his way, Before his works of old.
Proverbs||8||23||I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, Before the earth was.
Proverbs||8||24||When there were no depths, I was brought forth, When there were no fountains abounding with water.
Proverbs||8||25||Before the mountains were settled, Before the hills was I brought forth;
Proverbs||8||26||While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, Nor the beginning of the dust of the world.
Proverbs||8||27||When he established the heavens, I was there: When he set a circle upon the face of the deep,
Proverbs||8||28||When he made firm the skies above, When the fountains of the deep became strong,
Proverbs||8||29||When he gave to the sea its bound, That the waters should not transgress his commandment, When he marked out the foundations of the earth;
Proverbs||8||30||Then I was by him, as a master workman; And I was daily his delight, Rejoicing always before him,
Proverbs||8||31||Rejoicing in his habitable earth; And my delight was with the sons of men.
Proverbs||8||32||Now therefore, my sons, hearken unto me; For blessed are they that keep my ways.
Proverbs||8||33||Hear instruction, and be wise, And refuse it not.
Proverbs||8||34||Blessed is the man that heareth me, Watching daily at my gates, Waiting at the posts of my doors.
Proverbs||8||35||For whoso findeth me findeth life, And shall obtain favor of Jehovah.
Proverbs||8||36||But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: All they that hate me love death.
Proverbs||9||1||Wisdom hath builded her house; She hath hewn out her seven pillars:
Proverbs||9||2||She hath killed her beasts; She hath mingled her wine; She hath also furnished her table:
Proverbs||9||3||She hath sent forth her maidens; She crieth upon the highest places of the city:
Proverbs||9||4||Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: As for him that is void of understanding, she saith to him,
Proverbs||9||5||Come, eat ye of my bread, And drink of the wine which I have mingled.
Proverbs||9||6||Leave off, ye simple ones, and live; And walk in the way of understanding.
Proverbs||9||7||He that correcteth a scoffer getteth to himself reviling; And he that reproveth a wicked man getteth himself a blot.
Proverbs||9||8||Reprove not a scoffer, lest he hate thee: Reprove a wise man, and he will love thee.
Proverbs||9||9||Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: Teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.
Proverbs||9||10||The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; And the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.
Proverbs||9||11||For by me thy days shall be multiplied, And the years of thy life shall be increased.
Proverbs||9||12||If thou art wise, thou art wise for thyself; And if thou scoffest, thou alone shalt bear it.
Proverbs||9||13||The foolish woman is clamorous; She is simple, and knoweth nothing.
Proverbs||9||14||And she sitteth at the door of her house, On a seat in the high places of the city,
Proverbs||9||15||To call to them that pass by, Who go right on their ways:
Proverbs||9||16||Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither; And as for him that is void of understanding, she saith to him,
Proverbs||9||17||Stolen waters are sweet, And bread eaten in secret is pleasant.
Proverbs||9||18||But he knoweth not that the dead are there; That her guests are in the depths of Sheol.
Proverbs||10||1||The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father; But a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.
Proverbs||10||2||Treasures of wickedness profit nothing; But righteousness delivereth from death.
Proverbs||10||3||Jehovah will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish; But he thrusteth away the desire of the wicked.
Proverbs||10||4||He becometh poor that worketh with a slack hand; But the hand of the diligent maketh rich.
Proverbs||10||5||He that gathereth in summer is a wise son; But he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame.
Proverbs||10||6||Blessings are upon the head of the righteous; But violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.
Proverbs||10||7||The memory of the righteous is blessed; But the name of the wicked shall rot.
Proverbs||10||8||The wise in heart will receive commandments; But a prating fool shall fall.
Proverbs||10||9||He that walketh uprightly walketh surely; But he that perverteth his ways shall be known.
Proverbs||10||10||He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow; But a prating fool shall fall.
Proverbs||10||11||The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life; But violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.
Proverbs||10||12||Hatred stirreth up strifes; But love covereth all transgressions.
Proverbs||10||13||In the lips of him that hath discernment wisdom is found; But a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding.
Proverbs||10||14||Wise men lay up knowledge; But the mouth of the foolish is a present destruction.
Proverbs||10||15||The rich mans wealth is his strong city: The destruction of the poor is their poverty.
Proverbs||10||16||The labor of the righteous tendeth to life; The increase of the wicked, to sin.
Proverbs||10||17||He is in the way of life that heedeth correction; But he that forsaketh reproof erreth.
Proverbs||10||18||He that hideth hatred is of lying lips; And he that uttereth a slander is a fool.
Proverbs||10||19||In the multitude of words there wanteth not transgression; But he that refraineth his lips doeth wisely.
Proverbs||10||20||The tongue of the righteous is as choice silver: The heart of the wicked is little worth.
Proverbs||10||21||The lips of the righteous feed many; But the foolish die for lack of understanding.
Proverbs||10||22||The blessing of Jehovah, it maketh rich; And he addeth no sorrow therewith.
Proverbs||10||23||It is as sport to a fool to do wickedness; And so is wisdom to a man of understanding.
Proverbs||10||24||The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him; And the desire of the righteous shall be granted.
Proverbs||10||25||When the whirlwind passeth, the wicked is no more; But the righteous is an everlasting foundation.
Proverbs||10||26||As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, So is the sluggard to them that send him.
Proverbs||10||27||The fear of Jehovah prolongeth days; But the years of the wicked shall be shortened.
Proverbs||10||28||The hope of the righteous shall be gladness; But the expectation of the wicked shall perish.
Proverbs||10||29||The way of Jehovah is a stronghold to the upright; But it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity.
Proverbs||10||30||The righteous shall never be removed; But the wicked shall not dwell in the land.
Proverbs||10||31||The mouth of the righteous bringeth forth wisdom; But the perverse tongue shall be cut off.
Proverbs||10||32||The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable; But the mouth of the wicked speaketh perverseness.
Proverbs||11||1||A false balance is an abomination to Jehovah; But a just weight is his delight.
Proverbs||11||2||When pride cometh, then cometh shame; But with the lowly is wisdom.
Proverbs||11||3||The integrity of the upright shall guide them; But the perverseness of the treacherous shall destroy them.
