2 Timothy||1||1||Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,
2 Timothy||1||2||to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
2 Timothy||1||3||I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers in a pure conscience, how unceasing is my remembrance of thee in my supplications, night and day
2 Timothy||1||4||longing to see thee, remembering thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;
2 Timothy||1||5||having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in thee; which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and, I am persuaded, in thee also.
2 Timothy||1||6||For which cause I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee through the laying on of my hands.
2 Timothy||1||7||For God gave us not a spirit of fearfulness; but of power and love and discipline.
2 Timothy||1||8||Be not ashamed therefore of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but suffer hardship with the gospel according to the power of God;
2 Timothy||1||9||who saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,
2 Timothy||1||10||but hath now been manifested by the appearing of our Saviour Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,
2 Timothy||1||11||whereunto I was appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher.
2 Timothy||1||12||For which cause I suffer also these things: yet I am not ashamed; for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed unto him against that day.
2 Timothy||1||13||Hold the pattern of sound words which thou hast heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
2 Timothy||1||14||That good thing which was committed unto thee guard through the Holy Spirit which dwelleth in us.
2 Timothy||1||15||This thou knowest, that all that are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.
2 Timothy||1||16||The Lord grant mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus: for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain;
2 Timothy||1||17||but, when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me
2 Timothy||1||18||(the Lord grant unto him to find mercy of the Lord in that day); and in how many things he ministered at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.
2 Timothy||2||1||Thou therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
2 Timothy||2||2||And the things which thou hast heard from me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.
2 Timothy||2||3||Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
2 Timothy||2||4||No soldier on service entangleth himself in the affairs of this life; that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.
2 Timothy||2||5||And if also a man contend in the games, he is not crowded, except he have contended lawfully.
2 Timothy||2||6||The husbandmen that laboreth must be the first to partake of the fruits.
2 Timothy||2||7||Consider what I say; for the Lord shall give thee understanding in all things.
2 Timothy||2||8||Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel:
2 Timothy||2||9||wherein I suffer hardship unto bonds, as a malefactor; but the word of God is not bound.
2 Timothy||2||10||Therefore I endure all things for the elects sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
2 Timothy||2||11||Faithful is the saying: For if we died with him, we shall also live with him:
2 Timothy||2||12||if we endure, we shall also reign with him: if we shall deny him, he also will deny us:
2 Timothy||2||13||if we are faithless, he abideth faithful; for he cannot deny himself.
2 Timothy||2||14||Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them in the sight of the Lord, that they strive not about words, to no profit, to the subverting of them that hear.
2 Timothy||2||15||Give diligence to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, handling aright the word of truth.
2 Timothy||2||16||But shun profane babblings: for they will proceed further in ungodliness,
2 Timothy||2||17||and their word will eat as doth a gangrene: or whom is Hymenaeus an Philetus;
2 Timothy||2||18||men who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already, and overthrow the faith of some.
2 Timothy||2||19||Howbeit the firm foundation of God standeth, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his: and, Let every one that nameth the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.
2 Timothy||2||20||Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some unto honor, and some unto dishonor.
2 Timothy||2||21||If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, meet for the masters use, prepared unto every good work.
2 Timothy||2||22||after righteousness, faith, love, pace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
2 Timothy||2||23||But foolish and ignorant questionings refuse, knowing that they gender strifes.
2 Timothy||2||24||And the Lords servant must not strive, but be gentle towards all, apt to teach, forbearing,
2 Timothy||2||25||in meekness correcting them that oppose themselves; if peradventure God may give them repentance unto the knowledge of the truth,
2 Timothy||2||26||and they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him unto his will.
2 Timothy||3||1||But know this, that in the last days grievous times shall come.
2 Timothy||3||2||For men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, railers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
2 Timothy||3||3||without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good,
2 Timothy||3||4||traitors, headstrong, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;
2 Timothy||3||5||holding a form of godliness, but having denied the power therefore. From these also turn away.
2 Timothy||3||6||For of these are they that creep into houses, and take captive silly women laden with sins, led away by divers lusts,
2 Timothy||3||7||ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
2 Timothy||3||8||And even as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also withstand the truth. Men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.
2 Timothy||3||9||But they shall proceed no further. For their folly shall be evident unto all men, as theirs also came to be.
2 Timothy||3||10||But thou didst follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience,
2 Timothy||3||11||persecutions, sufferings. What things befell me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured. And out of them all the Lord delivered me.
2 Timothy||3||12||Yea, and all that would live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.
2 Timothy||3||13||But evil men and impostors shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.
2 Timothy||3||14||But abide thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them.
2 Timothy||3||15||And that from a babe thou hast known the sacred writings which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
2 Timothy||3||16||Every scripture inspired of God is also profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness.
2 Timothy||3||17||That the man of God may be complete, furnished completely unto every good work.
2 Timothy||4||1||I charge thee in the sight of God, and of Christ Jesus, who shall judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom:
2 Timothy||4||2||preach the word; be urgent in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching.
2 Timothy||4||3||For the time will come when they will not endure the sound doctrine; but, having itching ears, will heap to themselves teachers after their own lusts;
2 Timothy||4||4||and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside unto fables.
2 Timothy||4||5||But be thou sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfil thy ministry.
2 Timothy||4||6||For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure is come.
2 Timothy||4||7||I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith:
2 Timothy||4||8||henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give to me at that day; and not to me only, but also to all them that have loved his appearing.
2 Timothy||4||9||Give diligence to come shortly unto me:
2 Timothy||4||10||for Demas forsook me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.
2 Timothy||4||11||Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee; for he is useful to me for ministering.
2 Timothy||4||12||But Tychicus I sent to Ephesus.
2 Timothy||4||13||The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, bring when thou comest, and the books, especially the parchments.
2 Timothy||4||14||Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord will render to him according to his works:
2 Timothy||4||15||of whom do thou also beware; for he greatly withstood our words.
2 Timothy||4||16||At my first defence no one took my part, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their account.
2 Timothy||4||17||But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me; that through me the message might me fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.
2 Timothy||4||18||The Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
2 Timothy||4||19||Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.
2 Timothy||4||20||Erastus remained at Corinth: but Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.
2 Timothy||4||21||Give diligence to come before winter. Eubulus saluteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.
2 Timothy||4||22||The Lord be with thy spirit. Grace be with you.
