3 John||1||1||The elder unto Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth.
3 John||1||2||Beloved, I pray that in all things thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.
3 John||1||3||For I rejoiced greatly, when brethren came and bare witness unto thy truth, even as thou walkest in truth.
3 John||1||4||Greater joy have I none than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth.
3 John||1||5||Beloved, thou doest a faithful work in whatsoever thou doest toward them that are brethren and strangers withal;
3 John||1||6||who bare witness to thy love before the church: whom thou wilt do well to set forward on their journey worthily of God:
3 John||1||7||because that for the sake of the Name they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.
3 John||1||8||We therefore ought to welcome such, that we may be fellow-workers for the truth.
3 John||1||9||I wrote somewhat unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.
3 John||1||10||Therefore, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he doeth, prating against us with wicked words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and them that would he forbiddeth and casteth them out of the church.
3 John||1||11||Beloved, imitate not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: he that doeth evil hath not seen God.
3 John||1||12||Demetrius hath the witness of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, we also bear witness: and thou knowest that our witness is true.
3 John||1||13||I had many things to write unto thee, but I am unwilling to write them to thee with ink and pen:
3 John||1||14||but I hope shortly to see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be unto thee. The friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name.
