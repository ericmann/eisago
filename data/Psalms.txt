Psalms||69||1||Save me, O God; For the waters are come in unto my soul.
Psalms||69||2||I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.
Psalms||69||3||I am weary with my crying; my throat is dried: Mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.
Psalms||69||4||They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head: They that would cut me off, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: That which I took not away I have to restore.
Psalms||69||5||O God, thou knowest my foolishness; And my sins are not hid from thee.
Psalms||69||6||Let not them that wait for thee be put to shame through me, O Lord Jehovah of hosts: Let not those that seek thee be brought to dishonor through me, O God of Israel.
Psalms||69||7||Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; Shame hath covered my face.
Psalms||69||8||I am become a stranger unto my brethren, And an alien unto my mothers children.

Psalms||72||13||He will have pity on the poor and needy, And the souls of the needy he will save.
Psalms||72||14||He will redeem their soul from oppression and violence; And precious will their blood be in his sight:

Psalms||72||20||The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended. Psalm 73 A Psalm of Asaph.
Psalms||73||1||Surely God is good to Israel, Even to such as are pure in heart.
Psalms||73||2||But as for me, my feet were almost gone; My steps had well nigh slipped.
Psalms||73||3||For I was envious at the arrogant, When I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
Psalms||73||4||For there are no pangs in their death; But their strength is firm.
Psalms||73||5||They are not in trouble as other men; Neither are they plagued like other men.
Psalms||73||6||Therefore pride is as a chain about their neck; Violence covereth them as a garment.
Psalms||73||7||Their eyes stand out with fatness: They have more than heart could wish.
Psalms||73||8||They scoff, and in wickedness utter oppression: They speak loftily.
Psalms||73||9||They have set their mouth in the heavens, And their tongue walketh through the earth.
Psalms||73||10||Therefore his people return hither: And waters of a full cup are drained by them.
Psalms||73||11||And they say, How doth God know? And is there knowledge in the Most High?
Psalms||73||12||Behold, these are the wicked; And, being alway at ease, they increase in riches.
Psalms||73||13||Surely in vain have I cleansed my heart, And washed my hands in innocency;
Psalms||73||14||For all the day long have I been plagued, And chastened every morning.
Psalms||73||15||If I had said, I will speak thus; Behold, I had dealt treacherously with the generation of thy children.
Psalms||73||16||When I thought how I might know this, It was too painful for me;
Psalms||73||17||Until I went into the sanctuary of God, And considered their latter end.
Psalms||73||18||Surely thou settest them in slippery places: Thou castest them down to destruction.
Psalms||73||19||How are they become a desolation in a moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors.
Psalms||73||20||As a dream when one awaketh, So, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou wilt despise their image.
Psalms||73||21||For my soul was grieved, And I was pricked in my heart:
Psalms||73||22||So brutish was I, and ignorant; I was as a beast before thee.
Psalms||73||23||Nevertheless I am continually with thee: Thou hast holden my right hand.
Psalms||73||24||Thou wilt guide me with thy counsel, And afterward receive me to glory.
Psalms||73||25||Whom have I in heaven but thee? And there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee.
Psalms||73||26||My flesh and my heart faileth; But God is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever.
Psalms||73||27||For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: Thou hast destroyed all them that play the harlot, departing from thee.
Psalms||73||28||But it is good for me to draw near unto God: I have made the Lord Jehovah my refuge, That I may tell of all thy works. Psalm 74 Maschil of Asaph.
Psalms||74||1||O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? Why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?
Psalms||74||2||Remember thy congregation, which thou hast gotten of old, Which thou hast redeemed to be the tribe of thine inheritance; And mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.
Psalms||74||3||Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual ruins, All the evil that the enemy hath done in the sanctuary.
Psalms||74||4||Thine adversaries have roared in the midst of thine assembly; They have set up their ensigns for signs.
Psalms||74||5||They seemed as men that lifted up Axes upon a thicket of trees.
Psalms||74||6||And now all the carved work thereof They break down with hatchet and hammers.
Psalms||74||7||They have set thy sanctuary on fire; They have profaned the dwelling-place of thy name by casting it to the ground.
Psalms||74||8||They said in their heart, Let us make havoc of them altogether: They have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.
Psalms||74||9||We see not our signs: There is no more any prophet; Neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.
Psalms||74||10||How long, O God, shall the adversary reproach? Shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?
Psalms||74||11||Why drawest thou back thy hand, even thy right hand? Pluck it out of thy bosom and consume them.
Psalms||74||12||Yet God is my King of old, Working salvation in the midst of the earth.
Psalms||74||13||Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: Thou brakest the heads of the sea-monsters in the waters.
Psalms||74||14||Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces; Thou gavest him to be food to the people inhabiting the wilderness.
Psalms||74||15||Thou didst cleave fountain and flood: Thou driedst up mighty rivers.
Psalms||74||16||The day is thine, the night also is thine: Thou hast prepared the light and the sun.
Psalms||74||17||Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: Thou hast made summer and winter.
Psalms||74||18||Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O Jehovah, And that a foolish people hath blasphemed thy name.
Psalms||74||19||Oh deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the wild beast: Forget not the life of thy poor for ever.
Psalms||74||20||Have respect unto the covenant; For the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of violence.
Psalms||74||21||Oh let not the oppressed return ashamed: Let the poor and needy praise thy name.
Psalms||74||22||Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: Remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee all the day.
Psalms||74||23||Forget not the voice of thine adversaries: The tumult of those that rise up against thee ascendeth continually. Psalm 75 For the Chief Musician; set to Al-tash-heth. A Psalm of Asaph; a song.
Psalms||75||1||We give thanks unto thee, O God; We give thanks, for thy name is near: Men tell of thy wondrous works.
Psalms||75||2||When I shall find the set time, I will judge uprightly.
Psalms||75||3||The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I have set up the pillars of it. Selah
Psalms||75||4||I said unto the arrogant, Deal not arrogantly; And to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:
Psalms||75||5||Lift not up your horn on high; Speak not with a stiff neck.
Psalms||75||6||For neither from the east, nor from the west, Nor yet from the south, cometh lifting up.
Psalms||75||7||But God is the judge: He putteth down one, and lifteth up another.
Psalms||75||8||For in the hand of Jehovah there is a cup, and the wine foameth; It is full of mixture, and he poureth out of the same: Surely the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall drain them, and drink them.
Psalms||75||9||But I will declare for ever, I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
Psalms||75||10||All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; But the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up. Psalm 76 For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm of Asaph, a song.
Psalms||76||1||In Judah is God known: His name is great in Israel.
Psalms||76||2||In Salem also is his tabernacle, And his dwelling-place in Zion.
Psalms||76||3||There he brake the arrows of the bow; The shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah
Psalms||76||4||Glorious art thou and excellent, From the mountains of prey.
Psalms||76||5||The stouthearted are made a spoil, They have slept their sleep; And none of the men of might have found their hands.
Psalms||76||6||At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, Both chariot and horse are cast into a deep sleep.
Psalms||76||7||Thou, even thou, art to be feared; And who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?
Psalms||76||8||Thou didst cause sentence to be heard from heaven; The earth feared, and was still,
Psalms||76||9||When God arose to judgment, To save all the meek of the earth. Selah
Psalms||76||10||Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: The residue of wrath shalt thou gird upon thee.
Psalms||76||11||Vow, and pay unto Jehovah your God: Let all that are round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.
Psalms||76||12||He will cut off the spirit of princes: He is terrible to the kings of the earth. Psalm 77 For the Chief Musician; after the manner of Jeduthan. A Psalm of Asaph.
Psalms||77||1||I will cry unto God with my voice, Even unto God with my voice; and he will give ear unto me.
Psalms||77||2||In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: My hand was stretched out in the night, and slacked not; My soul refused to be comforted.
Psalms||77||3||I remember God, and am disquieted: I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. Selah
Psalms||77||4||Thou holdest mine eyes watching: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
Psalms||77||5||I have considered the days of old, The years of ancient times.
Psalms||77||6||I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart; And my spirit maketh diligent search.
Psalms||77||7||Will the Lord cast off for ever? And will he be favorable no more?
Psalms||77||8||Is his lovingkindness clean gone for ever? Doth his promise fail for evermore?
Psalms||77||9||Hath God forgotten to be gracious? Hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah
Psalms||77||10||And I said, This is my infirmity; But I will remember the years of the right hand of the Most High.
Psalms||77||11||I will make mention of the deeds of Jehovah; For I will remember thy wonders of old.
Psalms||77||12||I will meditate also upon all thy work, And muse on thy doings.
Psalms||77||13||Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: Who is a great god like unto God?
Psalms||77||14||Thou art the God that doest wonders: Thou hast made known thy strength among the peoples.
Psalms||77||15||Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah
Psalms||77||16||The waters saw thee, O God; The waters saw thee, they were afraid: The depths also trembled.
Psalms||77||17||The clouds poured out water; The skies sent out a sound: Thine arrows also went abroad.
Psalms||77||18||The voice of thy thunder was in the whirlwind; The lightnings lightened the world: The earth trembled and shook.
Psalms||77||19||Thy way was in the sea, And thy paths in the great waters, And thy footsteps were not known.
Psalms||77||20||Thou leddest thy people like a flock, By the hand of Moses and Aaron. Psalm 78 Maschil of Asaph.
Psalms||78||1||Give ear, O my people, to my law: Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
Psalms||78||2||I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings of old,
Psalms||78||3||Which we have heard and known, And our fathers have told us.
Psalms||78||4||We will not hide them from their children, Telling to the generation to come the praises of Jehovah, And his strength, and his wondrous works that he hath done.
Psalms||78||5||For he established a testimony in Jacob, And appointed a law in Israel, Which he commanded our fathers, That they should make them known to their children;
Psalms||78||6||That the generation to come might know them, even the children that should be born; Who should arise and tell them to their children,
Psalms||78||7||That they might set their hope in God, And not forget the works of God, But keep his commandments,
Psalms||78||8||And might not be as their fathers, A stubborn and rebellious generation, A generation that set not their heart aright, And whose spirit was not stedfast with God.
Psalms||78||9||The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, Turned back in the day of battle.
Psalms||78||10||They kept not the covenant of God, And refused to walk in his law;
Psalms||78||11||And they forgat his doings, And his wondrous works that he had showed them.
Psalms||78||12||Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
Psalms||78||13||He clave the sea, and caused them to pass through; And he made the waters to stand as a heap.
Psalms||78||14||In the day-time also he led them with a cloud, And all the night with a light of fire.
Psalms||78||15||He clave rocks in the wilderness, And gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.
Psalms||78||16||He brought streams also out of the rock, And caused waters to run down like rivers.
Psalms||78||17||Yet went they on still to sin against him, To rebel against the Most High in the desert.
Psalms||78||18||And they tempted God in their heart By asking food according to their desire.
Psalms||78||19||Yea, they spake against God; They said, Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?
Psalms||78||20||Behold, he smote the rock, so that waters gushed out, And streams overflowed; Can he give bread also? Will he provide flesh for his people?
Psalms||78||21||Therefore Jehovah heard, and was wroth; And a fire was kindled against Jacob, And anger also went up against Israel;
Psalms||78||22||Because they believed not in God, And trusted not in his salvation.
Psalms||78||23||Yet he commanded the skies above, And opened the doors of heaven;
Psalms||78||24||And he rained down manna upon them to eat, And gave them food from heaven.
Psalms||78||25||Man did eat the bread of the mighty: He sent them food to the full.
Psalms||78||26||He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens; And by his power he guided the south wind.
Psalms||78||27||He rained flesh also upon them as the dust, And winged birds as the sand of the seas:
Psalms||78||28||And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, Round about their habitations.
Psalms||78||29||So they did eat, and were well filled; And he gave them their own desire.
Psalms||78||30||They were not estranged from that which they desired, Their food was yet in their mouths,
Psalms||78||31||When the anger of God went up against them, And slew of the fattest of them, And smote down the young men of Israel.
Psalms||78||32||For all this they sinned still, And believed not in his wondrous works.
Psalms||78||33||Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, And their years in terror.
Psalms||78||34||When he slew them, then they inquired after him; And they returned and sought God earnestly.
Psalms||78||35||And they remembered that God was their rock, And the Most High God their redeemer.
Psalms||78||36||But they flattered him with their mouth, And lied unto him with their tongue.
Psalms||78||37||For their heart was not right with him, Neither were they faithful in his covenant.
Psalms||78||38||But he, being merciful, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: Yea, many a time turned he his anger away, And did not stir up all his wrath.
Psalms||78||39||And he remembered that they were but flesh, A wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.
Psalms||78||40||How oft did they rebel against him in the wilderness, And grieve him in the desert!
Psalms||78||41||And they turned again and tempted God, And provoked the Holy One of Israel.
Psalms||78||42||They remember not his hand, Nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;
Psalms||78||43||How he set his signs in Egypt, And his wonders in the field of Zoan,
Psalms||78||44||And turned their rivers into blood, And their streams, so that they could not drink.
Psalms||78||45||He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; And frogs, which destroyed them.
Psalms||78||46||He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar, And their labor unto the locust.
Psalms||78||47||He destroyed their vines with hail, And their sycomore-trees with frost.
Psalms||78||48||He gave over their cattle also to the hail, And their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
Psalms||78||49||He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, Wrath, and indignation, and trouble, A band of angels of evil.
Psalms||78||50||He made a path for his anger; He spared not their soul from death, But gave their life over to the pestilence,
Psalms||78||51||And smote all the first-born in Egypt, The chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.
Psalms||78||52||But he led forth his own people like sheep, And guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
Psalms||78||53||And he led them safely, so that they feared not; But the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
Psalms||78||54||And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, To this mountain, which his right hand had gotten.
Psalms||78||55||He drove out the nations also before them, And allotted them for an inheritance by line, And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
Psalms||78||56||Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, And kept not his testimonies;
Psalms||78||57||But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers: They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
Psalms||78||58||For they provoked him to anger with their high places, And moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
Psalms||78||59||When God heard this, he was wroth, And greatly abhorred Israel;
Psalms||78||60||So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, The tent which he placed among men;
Psalms||78||61||And delivered his strength into captivity, And his glory into the adversarys hand.

Psalms||78||67||Moreover he refused the tent of Joseph, And chose not the tribe of Ephraim,
Psalms||78||68||But chose the tribe of Judah, The mount Zion which he loved.
Psalms||78||69||And he built his sanctuary like the heights, Like the earth which he hath established for ever.
Psalms||78||70||He chose David also his servant, And took him from the sheepfolds:
Psalms||78||71||From following the ewes that have their young he brought him, To be the shepherd of Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
Psalms||78||72||So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, And guided them by the skilfulness of his hands. Psalm 79 A Psalm of Asaph.

Psalms||79||3||Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; And there was none to bury them.
Psalms||79||4||We are become a reproach to our neighbors, A scoffing and derision to them that are round about us.
Psalms||79||5||How long, O Jehovah? wilt thou be angry for ever? Shall thy jealousy burn like fire?
Psalms||79||6||Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that know thee not, And upon the kingdoms that call not upon thy name.
Psalms||79||7||For they have devoured Jacob, And laid waste his habitation.
Psalms||79||8||Remember not against us the iniquities of our forefathers: Let thy tender mercies speedily meet us; For we are brought very low.

Psalms||79||11||Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee: According to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to death;

Psalms||80||9||Thou preparedst room before it, And it took deep root, and filled the land.
Psalms||80||10||The mountains were covered with the shadow of it, And the boughs thereof were like cedars of God.
Psalms||80||11||It sent out its branches unto the sea, And its shoots unto the River.
Psalms||80||12||Why hast thou broken down its walls, So that all they that pass by the way do pluck it?
Psalms||80||13||The boar out of the wood doth ravage it, And the wild beasts of the field feed on it.
Psalms||80||14||Turn again, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: Look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine,
Psalms||80||15||And the stock which thy right hand planted, And the branch that thou madest strong for thyself.

Psalms||80||17||Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, Upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.

Psalms||81||6||I removed his shoulder from the burden: His hands were freed from the basket.
Psalms||81||7||Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder; I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah

Psalms||81||12||So I let them go after the stubbornness of their heart, That they might walk in their own counsels.
Psalms||81||13||Oh that my people would hearken unto me, That Israel would walk in my ways!
Psalms||81||14||I would soon subdue their enemies, And turn my hand against their adversaries.

Psalms||83||4||They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; That the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.

Psalms||89||47||Oh remember how short my time is: For what vanity hast thou created all the children of men!
Psalms||89||48||What man is he that shall live and not see death, That shall deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah

Psalms||102||18||This shall be written for the generation to come; And a people which shall be created shall praise Jehovah.
Psalms||102||19||For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; From heaven did Jehovah behold the earth;
Psalms||102||20||To hear the sighing of the prisoner; To loose those that are appointed to death;

Psalms||103||3||Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; Who healeth all thy diseases;
Psalms||103||4||Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; Who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;
Psalms||103||5||Who satisfieth thy desire with good things, So that thy youth is renewed like the eagle.
Psalms||103||6||Jehovah executeth righteous acts, And judgments for all that are oppressed.
Psalms||103||7||He made known his ways unto Moses, His doings unto the children of Israel.
Psalms||103||8||Jehovah is merciful and gracious, Slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness.
Psalms||103||9||He will not always chide; Neither will he keep his anger for ever.
Psalms||103||10||He hath not dealt with us after our sins, Nor rewarded us after our iniquities.
Psalms||103||11||For as the heavens are high above the earth, So great is his lovingkindness toward them that fear him.
Psalms||103||12||As far as the east is from the west, So far hath he removed our transgressions from us.
Psalms||103||13||Like as a father pitieth his children, So Jehovah pitieth them that fear him.
Psalms||103||14||For he knoweth our frame; He remembereth that we are dust.
Psalms||103||15||As for man, his days are as grass; As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.
Psalms||103||16||For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; And the place thereof shall know it no more.

Psalms||103||18||To such as keep his covenant, And to those that remember his precepts to do them.

Psalms||103||22||Bless Jehovah, all ye his works, In all places of his dominion: Bless Jehovah, O my soul.
Psalms||104||1||Bless Jehovah, O my soul. O Jehovah my God, thou art very great; Thou art clothed with honor and majesty:
Psalms||104||2||Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment; Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain;
Psalms||104||3||Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters; Who maketh the clouds his chariot; Who walketh upon the wings of the wind;
Psalms||104||4||Who maketh winds his messengers; Flames of fire his ministers;
Psalms||104||5||Who laid the foundations of the earth, That it should not be moved for ever.
Psalms||104||6||Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a vesture; The waters stood above the mountains.
Psalms||104||7||At thy rebuke they fled; At the voice of thy thunder they hasted away
Psalms||104||8||(The mountains rose, the valleys sank down) Unto the place which thou hadst founded for them.
Psalms||104||9||Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; That they turn not again to cover the earth.
Psalms||104||10||He sendeth forth springs into the valleys; They run among the mountains;
Psalms||104||11||They give drink to every beast of the field; The wild asses quench their thirst.
Psalms||104||12||By them the birds of the heavens have their habitation; They sing among the branches.
Psalms||104||13||He watereth the mountains from his chambers: The earth is filled with the fruit of thy works.
Psalms||104||14||He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, And herb for the service of man; That he may bring forth food out of the earth,
Psalms||104||15||And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, And oil to make his face to shine, And bread that strengtheneth mans heart.
Psalms||104||16||The trees of Jehovah are filled with moisture, The cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;
Psalms||104||17||Where the birds make their nests: As for the stork, the fir-trees are her house.
Psalms||104||18||The high mountains are for the wild goats; The rocks are a refuge for the conies.
Psalms||104||19||He appointed the moon for seasons: The sun knoweth his going down.
Psalms||104||20||Thou makest darkness, and it is night, Wherein all the beasts of the forest creep forth.
Psalms||104||21||The young lions roar after their prey, And seek their food from God.
Psalms||104||22||The sun ariseth, they get them away, And lay them down in their dens.
Psalms||104||23||Man goeth forth unto his work And to his labor until the evening.
Psalms||104||24||O Jehovah, how manifold are thy works! In wisdom hast thou made them all: The earth is full of thy riches.
Psalms||104||25||Yonder is the sea, great and wide, Wherein are things creeping innumerable, Both small and great beasts.
Psalms||104||26||There go the ships; There is leviathan, whom thou hast formed to play therein.
Psalms||104||27||These wait all for thee, That thou mayest give them their food in due season.
Psalms||104||28||Thou givest unto them, they gather; Thou openest thy hand, they are satisfied with good.
Psalms||104||29||Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled; Thou takest away their breath, they die, And return to their dust.
Psalms||104||30||Thou sendest forth thy Spirit, they are created; And thou renewest the face of the ground.
Psalms||104||31||Let the glory of Jehovah endure for ever; Let Jehovah rejoice in his works:
Psalms||104||32||Who looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; He toucheth the mountains, and they smoke.
Psalms||104||33||I will sing unto Jehovah as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.
Psalms||104||34||Let thy meditation be sweet unto him: I will rejoice in Jehovah.
Psalms||104||35||Let sinners be consumed out of the earth. And let the wicked be no more. Bless Jehovah, O my soul. Praise ye Jehovah.
Psalms||105||1||Oh give thanks unto Jehovah, call upon his name; Make known among the peoples his doings.
Psalms||105||2||Sing unto him, sing praises unto him; Talk ye of all his marvelous works.
Psalms||105||3||Glory ye in his holy name: Let the heart of them rejoice that seek Jehovah.
Psalms||105||4||Seek ye Jehovah and his strength; Seek his face evermore.
Psalms||105||5||Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,
Psalms||105||6||O ye seed of Abraham his servant, Ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.
Psalms||105||7||He is Jehovah our God: His judgments are in all the earth.
Psalms||105||8||He hath remembered his covenant for ever, The word which he commanded to a thousand generations,
Psalms||105||9||The covenant which he made with Abraham, And his oath unto Isaac,
Psalms||105||10||And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute, To Israel for an everlasting covenant,
Psalms||105||11||Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, The lot of your inheritance;
Psalms||105||12||When they were but a few men in number, Yea, very few, and sojourners in it.
Psalms||105||13||And they went about from nation to nation, From one kingdom to another people.
Psalms||105||14||He suffered no man to do them wrong; Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,
Psalms||105||15||Saying, Touch not mine anointed ones, And do my prophets no harm.
Psalms||105||16||And he called for a famine upon the land; He brake the whole staff of bread.
Psalms||105||17||He sent a man before them; Joseph was sold for a servant:
Psalms||105||18||His feet they hurt with fetters: He was laid in chains of iron,
Psalms||105||19||Until the time that his word came to pass, The word of Jehovah tried him.
Psalms||105||20||The king sent and loosed him; Even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free.
Psalms||105||21||He made him lord of his house, And ruler of all his substance;
Psalms||105||22||To bind his princes at his pleasure, And teach his elders wisdom.
Psalms||105||23||Israel also came into Egypt; And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
Psalms||105||24||And he increased his people greatly, And made them stronger than their adversaries.
Psalms||105||25||He turned their heart to hate his people, To deal subtly with his servants.
Psalms||105||26||He sent Moses his servant, And Aaron whom he had chosen.
Psalms||105||27||They set among them his signs, And wonders in the land of Ham.
Psalms||105||28||He sent darkness, and made it dark; And they rebelled not against his words.
Psalms||105||29||He turned their waters into blood, And slew their fish.
Psalms||105||30||Their land swarmed with frogs In the chambers of their kings.
Psalms||105||31||He spake, and there came swarms of flies, And lice in all their borders.
Psalms||105||32||He gave them hail for rain, And flaming fire in their land.
Psalms||105||33||He smote their vines also and their fig-trees, And brake the trees of their borders.
Psalms||105||34||He spake, and the locust came, And the grasshopper, and that without number,
Psalms||105||35||And did eat up every herb in their land, And did eat up the fruit of their ground.
Psalms||105||36||He smote also all the first-born in their land, The chief of all their strength.
Psalms||105||37||And he brought them forth with silver and gold; And there was not one feeble person among his tribes.
Psalms||105||38||Egypt was glad when they departed; For the fear of them had fallen upon them.
Psalms||105||39||He spread a cloud for a covering, And fire to give light in the night.
Psalms||105||40||They asked, and he brought quails, And satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
Psalms||105||41||He opened the rock, and waters gushed out; They ran in the dry places like a river.
Psalms||105||42||For he remembered his holy word, And Abraham his servant.
Psalms||105||43||And he brought forth his people with joy, And his chosen with singing.
Psalms||105||44||And he gave them the lands of the nations; And they took the labor of the peoples in possession:
Psalms||105||45||That they might keep his statutes, And observe his laws. Praise ye Jehovah.
Psalms||106||1||Praise ye Jehovah. Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness endureth forever.
Psalms||106||2||Who can utter the mighty acts of Jehovah, Or show forth all his praise?
Psalms||106||3||Blessed are they that keep justice, And he that doeth righteousness at all times.
Psalms||106||4||Remember me, O Jehovah, with the favor that thou bearest unto thy people; Oh visit me with thy salvation,
Psalms||106||5||That I may see the prosperity of thy chosen, That I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, That I may glory with thine inheritance.
Psalms||106||6||We have sinned with our fathers, We have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.
Psalms||106||7||Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; They remembered not the multitude of thy lovingkindnesses, But were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.
Psalms||106||8||Nevertheless he saved them for his names sake, That he might make his mighty power to be known.
Psalms||106||9||He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up: So he led them through the depths, as through a wilderness.
Psalms||106||10||And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
Psalms||106||11||And the waters covered their adversaries; There was not one of them left.
Psalms||106||12||Then believed they his words; They sang his praise.
Psalms||106||13||They soon forgat his works; They waited not for his counsel,
Psalms||106||14||But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, And tempted God in the desert.
Psalms||106||15||And he gave them their request, But sent leanness into their soul.
Psalms||106||16||They envied Moses also in the camp, And Aaron the saint of Jehovah.
Psalms||106||17||The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, And covered the company of Abiram.
Psalms||106||18||And a fire was kindled in their company; The flame burned up the wicked.
Psalms||106||19||They made a calf in Horeb, And worshipped a molten image.
Psalms||106||20||Thus they changed their glory For the likeness of an ox that eateth grass.
Psalms||106||21||They forgat God their Saviour, Who had done great things in Egypt,
Psalms||106||22||Wondrous works in the land of Ham, And terrible things by the Red Sea.
Psalms||106||23||Therefore he said that he would destroy them, Had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.
Psalms||106||24||Yea, they despised the pleasant land, They believed not his word,
Psalms||106||25||But murmured in their tents, And hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah.
Psalms||106||26||Therefore he sware unto them, That he would overthrow them in the wilderness,
Psalms||106||27||And that he would overthrow their seed among the nations, And scatter them in the lands.
Psalms||106||28||They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, And ate the sacrifices of the dead.
Psalms||106||29||Thus they provoked him to anger with their doings; And the plague brake in upon them.
Psalms||106||30||Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment; And so the plague was stayed.
Psalms||106||31||And that was reckoned unto him for righteousness, Unto all generations for evermore.
Psalms||106||32||They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes;
Psalms||106||33||Because they were rebellious against his spirit, And he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
Psalms||106||34||They did not destroy the peoples, As Jehovah commanded them,
Psalms||106||35||But mingled themselves with the nations, And learned their works,
Psalms||106||36||And served their idols, Which became a snare unto them.
Psalms||106||37||Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons,
Psalms||106||38||And shed innocent blood, Even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, Whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; And the land was polluted with blood.
Psalms||106||39||Thus were they defiled with their works, And played the harlot in their doings.
Psalms||106||40||Therefore was the wrath of Jehovah kindled against his people, And he abhorred his inheritance.
Psalms||106||41||And he gave them into the hand of the nations; And they that hated them ruled over them.
Psalms||106||42||Their enemies also oppressed them, And they were brought into subjection under their hand.
Psalms||106||43||Many times did he deliver them; But they were rebellious in their counsel, And were brought low in their iniquity.
Psalms||106||44||Nevertheless he regarded their distress, When he heard their cry:
Psalms||106||45||And he remembered for them his covenant, And repented according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.
Psalms||106||46||He made them also to be pitied Of all those that carried them captive.
Psalms||106||47||Save us, O Jehovah our God, And gather us from among the nations, To give thanks unto thy holy name, And to triumph in thy praise.
Psalms||106||48||Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, From everlasting even to everlasting. And let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye Jehovah.
Psalms||107||1||O give thanks unto Jehovah; For he is good; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever.
Psalms||107||2||Let the redeemed of Jehovah say so, Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary,
Psalms||107||3||And gathered out of the lands, From the east and from the west, From the north and from the south.
Psalms||107||4||They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way; They found no city of habitation.
Psalms||107||5||Hungry and thirsty, Their soul fainted in them.
Psalms||107||6||Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he delivered them out of their distresses,
Psalms||107||7||He led them also by a straight way, That they might go to a city of habitation.
Psalms||107||8||Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!
Psalms||107||9||For he satisfieth the longing soul, And the hungry soul he filleth with good.
Psalms||107||10||Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, Being bound in affliction and iron,
Psalms||107||11||Because they rebelled against the words of God, And contemned the counsel of the Most High:
Psalms||107||12||Therefore he brought down their heart with labor; They fell down, and there was none to help.
Psalms||107||13||Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he saved them out of their distresses.
Psalms||107||14||He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, And brake their bonds in sunder.
Psalms||107||15||Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!
Psalms||107||16||For he hath broken the gates of brass, And cut the bars of iron in sunder.

Psalms||107||26||They mount up to the heavens, they go down again to the depths: Their soul melteth away because of trouble.
Psalms||107||27||They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, And are at their wits end.
Psalms||107||28||Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble, And he bringeth them out of their distresses.
Psalms||107||29||He maketh the storm a calm, So that the waves thereof are still.
Psalms||107||30||Then are they glad because they are quiet; So he bringeth them unto their desired haven.
Psalms||107||31||Oh that men would praise Jehovah for his lovingkindness, And for his wonderful works to the children of men!
Psalms||107||32||Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people, And praise him in the seat of the elders.
Psalms||107||33||He turneth rivers into a wilderness, And watersprings into a thirsty ground;
Psalms||107||34||A fruitful land into a salt desert, For the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
Psalms||107||35||He turneth a wilderness into a pool of water, And a dry land into watersprings.
Psalms||107||36||And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, That they may prepare a city of habitation,
Psalms||107||37||And sow fields, and plant vineyards, And get them fruits of increase.
Psalms||107||38||He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; And he suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
Psalms||107||39||Again, they are diminished and bowed down Through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.
Psalms||107||40||He poureth contempt upon princes, And causeth them to wander in the waste, where there is no way.

Psalms||109||14||Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with Jehovah; And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
Psalms||109||15||Let them be before Jehovah continually, That he may cut off the memory of them from the earth;
Psalms||109||16||Because he remembered not to show kindness, But persecuted the poor and needy man, And the broken in heart, to slay them.
Psalms||109||17||Yea, he loved cursing, and it came unto him; And he delighted not in blessing, and it was far from him.
Psalms||109||18||He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment, And it came into his inward parts like water, And like oil into his bones.
Psalms||109||19||Let it be unto him as the raiment wherewith he covereth himself, And for the girdle wherewith he is girded continually.
Psalms||109||20||This is the reward of mine adversaries from Jehovah, And of them that speak evil against my soul.
