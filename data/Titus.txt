Titus||1||1||Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of Gods elect, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,
Titus||1||2||in hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before times eternal;
Titus||1||3||but in his own seasons manifested his word in the message, wherewith I was intrusted according to the commandment of God our Saviour;
Titus||1||4||to Titus, my true child after a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour.
Titus||1||5||For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that were wanting, and appoint elders in every city, as I gave thee charge;
Titus||1||6||if any man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children that believe, who are not accused of riot or unruly.
Titus||1||7||For the bishop must be blameless, as Gods steward; not self-willed, not soon angry, no brawler, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre;
Titus||1||8||but given to hospitality, as lover of good, sober-minded, just, holy, self-controlled;
Titus||1||9||holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict the gainsayers.
Titus||1||10||For there are many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision,
Titus||1||11||whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucres sake.
Titus||1||12||One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, idle gluttons.
Titus||1||13||This testimony is true. For which cause reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,
Titus||1||14||not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.
Titus||1||15||To the pure all things are pure: but to them that are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.
Titus||1||16||They profess that they know God; but by their works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.
Titus||2||1||But speak thou the things which befit the sound doctrine:
Titus||2||2||that aged men be temperate, grave, sober-minded, sound in faith, in love, in patience:
Titus||2||3||that aged women likewise be reverent in demeanor, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good;
Titus||2||4||that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,
Titus||2||5||to be sober-minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed:
Titus||2||6||the younger men likewise exhort to be sober-minded:
Titus||2||7||in all things showing thyself an ensample of good works; in thy doctrine showing uncorruptness, gravity,
Titus||2||8||sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of us.
Titus||2||9||Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters, and to be well-pleasing to them in all things; not gainsaying;
Titus||2||10||not purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.
Titus||2||11||For the grace of God hath appeared, bringing salvation to all men,
Titus||2||12||instructing us, to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly and righteously and godly in this present world;
Titus||2||13||looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;
Titus||2||14||who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a people for his own possession, zealous of good works.
Titus||2||15||These things speak and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise thee.
Titus||3||1||Put them in mind to be in subjection to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready unto every good work,
Titus||3||2||to speak evil of no man, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all meekness toward all men.
Titus||3||3||For we also once were foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.
Titus||3||4||But when the kindness of God our Saviour, and his love toward man, appeared,
Titus||3||5||not by works done in righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit,
Titus||3||6||which he poured out upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour;
Titus||3||7||that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
Titus||3||8||Faithful is the saying, and concerning these things I desire that thou affirm confidently, to the end that they who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men:
Titus||3||9||but shun foolish questionings, and genealogies, and strifes, and fightings about law; for they are unprofitable and vain.
Titus||3||10||A factious man after a first and second admonition refuse;
Titus||3||11||knowing that such a one is perverted, and sinneth, being self-condemned.
Titus||3||12||When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, give diligence to come unto me to Nicopolis: for there I have determined to winter.
Titus||3||13||Set forward Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.
Titus||3||14||And let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.
Titus||3||15||All that are with me salute thee. Salute them that love us in faith. Grace be with you all.
