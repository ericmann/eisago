1 Chronicles||15||12||and said unto them, Ye are the heads of the fathers houses of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of Jehovah, the God of Israel, unto the place that I have prepared for it.
1 Chronicles||15||13||For because ye bare it not at the first, Jehovah our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not according to the ordinance.
1 Chronicles||15||14||So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Jehovah, the God of Israel.
1 Chronicles||15||15||And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of Jehovah.
1 Chronicles||15||16||And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren the singers, with instruments of music, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting up the voice with joy.

1 Chronicles||15||24||And Shebaniah, and Joshaphat, and Nethanel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.
1 Chronicles||15||25||So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the house of Obed-edom with joy.
1 Chronicles||15||26||And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, that they sacrificed seven bullocks and seven rams.

1 Chronicles||15||29||And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David dancing and playing; and she despised him in her heart.
1 Chronicles||16||1||And they brought in the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before God.
1 Chronicles||16||2||And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah.
1 Chronicles||16||3||And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a portion of flesh, and a cake of raisins.
1 Chronicles||16||4||And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of Jehovah, and to celebrate and to thank and praise Jehovah, the God of Israel:
1 Chronicles||16||5||Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, with psalteries and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud;
1 Chronicles||16||6||and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God.
1 Chronicles||16||7||Then on that day did David first ordain to give thanks unto Jehovah, by the hand of Asaph and his brethren.
1 Chronicles||16||8||O give thanks unto Jehovah, call upon his name; Make known his doings among the peoples.
1 Chronicles||16||9||Sing unto him, sing praises unto him; Talk ye of all his marvellous works.
1 Chronicles||16||10||Glory ye in his holy name; Let the heart of them rejoice that seek Jehovah.
1 Chronicles||16||11||Seek ye Jehovah and his strength; Seek his face evermore.
1 Chronicles||16||12||Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,
1 Chronicles||16||13||O ye seed of Israel his servant, Ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.
1 Chronicles||16||14||He is Jehovah our God; His judgments are in all the earth.
1 Chronicles||16||15||Remember his covenant for ever, The word which he commanded to a thousand generations,
1 Chronicles||16||16||The covenant which he made with Abraham, And his oath unto Isaac,
1 Chronicles||16||17||And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute, To Israel for an everlasting covenant,
1 Chronicles||16||18||Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, The lot of your inheritance;
1 Chronicles||16||19||When ye were but a few men in number, Yea, very few, and sojourners in it;
1 Chronicles||16||20||And they went about from nation to nation, And from one kingdom to another people.
1 Chronicles||16||21||He suffered no man to do them wrong; Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,
1 Chronicles||16||22||Saying, Touch not mine anointed ones, And do my prophets no harm.
1 Chronicles||16||23||Sing unto Jehovah, all the earth; Show forth his salvation from day to day.
1 Chronicles||16||24||Declare his glory among the nations, His marvellous works among all the peoples.
1 Chronicles||16||25||For great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised: He also is to be feared above all gods.
1 Chronicles||16||26||For all the gods of the peoples are idols: But Jehovah made the heavens.
1 Chronicles||16||27||Honor and majesty are before him: Strength and gladness are in his place.
1 Chronicles||16||28||Ascribe unto Jehovah, ye kindreds of the peoples, Ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength;
1 Chronicles||16||29||Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due unto his name: Bring an offering, and come before him: Worship Jehovah in holy array.
1 Chronicles||16||30||Tremble before him, all the earth: The world also is established that it cannot be moved.
1 Chronicles||16||31||Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; And let them say among the nations, Jehovah reigneth.
1 Chronicles||16||32||Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; Let the field exult, and all that is therein;
1 Chronicles||16||33||Then shall the trees of the wood sing for joy before Jehovah; For he cometh to judge the earth.
1 Chronicles||16||34||O give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever.
1 Chronicles||16||35||And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, And gather us together and deliver us from the nations, To give thanks unto thy holy name, And to triumph in thy praise.
1 Chronicles||16||36||Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, From everlasting even to everlasting. And all the people said, Amen, and praised Jehovah.
1 Chronicles||16||37||So he left there, before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every days work required;
1 Chronicles||16||38||and Obed-edom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be doorkeepers;
1 Chronicles||16||39||and Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of Jehovah in the high place that was at Gibeon,
1 Chronicles||16||40||to offer burnt-offerings unto Jehovah upon the altar of burnt-offering continually morning and evening, even according to all that is written in the law of Jehovah, which he commanded unto Israel;
1 Chronicles||16||41||and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were mentioned by name, to give thanks to Jehovah, because his lovingkindness endureth for ever;
1 Chronicles||16||42||and with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud, and with instruments for the songs of God; and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate.
1 Chronicles||16||43||And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.
1 Chronicles||17||1||And it came to pass, when David dwelt in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of Jehovah dwelleth under curtains.
1 Chronicles||17||2||And Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thy heart; for God is with thee.
1 Chronicles||17||3||And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,
1 Chronicles||17||4||Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith Jehovah, Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in:
1 Chronicles||17||5||for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel, unto this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another.
1 Chronicles||17||6||In all places wherein I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedar?
1 Chronicles||17||7||Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over my people Israel:
1 Chronicles||17||8||and I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast gone, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth.
1 Chronicles||17||9||And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the first,
1 Chronicles||17||10||and as from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will subdue all thine enemies. Moreover I tell thee that Jehovah will build thee a house.
1 Chronicles||17||11||And it shall come to pass, when thy days are fulfilled that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will set up thy seed after thee, who shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.
1 Chronicles||17||12||He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever.
1 Chronicles||17||13||I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my lovingkindness away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee;
1 Chronicles||17||14||but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever; and his throne shall be established for ever.
1 Chronicles||17||15||According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.
1 Chronicles||17||16||Then David the king went in, and sat before Jehovah; and he said, Who am I, O Jehovah God, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me thus far?
1 Chronicles||17||17||And this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; but thou hast spoken of thy servants house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O Jehovah God.
1 Chronicles||17||18||What can David say yet more unto thee concerning the honor which is done to thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.
1 Chronicles||17||19||O Jehovah, for thy servants sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou wrought all this greatness, to make known all these great things.
1 Chronicles||17||20||O Jehovah, there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
1 Chronicles||17||21||And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem unto himself for a people, to make thee a name by great and terrible things, in driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou redeemest out of Egypt?
1 Chronicles||17||22||For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, Jehovah, becamest their God.
1 Chronicles||17||23||And now, O Jehovah, let the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, be established for ever, and do as thou hast spoken.
1 Chronicles||17||24||And let thy name be established and magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and the house of David thy servant is established before thee.
1 Chronicles||17||25||For thou, O my God, hast revealed to thy servant that thou wilt build him a house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray before thee.
1 Chronicles||17||26||And now, O Jehovah, thou art God, and hast promised this good thing unto thy servant:
1 Chronicles||17||27||and now it hath pleased thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Jehovah, hast blessed, and it is blessed for ever.
1 Chronicles||18||1||And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out of the hand of the Philistines.
1 Chronicles||18||2||And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became servants to David, and brought tribute.
1 Chronicles||18||3||And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates.
1 Chronicles||18||4||And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen; and David hocked all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for a hundred chariots.
1 Chronicles||18||5||And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succor Hadarezer king of Zobah, David smote of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
1 Chronicles||18||6||Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute. And Jehovah gave victory to David whithersoever he went.
1 Chronicles||18||7||And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles||18||8||And from Tibhath and from Cun, cities of Hadarezer, David took very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brazen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.
1 Chronicles||18||9||And when Tou king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah,
1 Chronicles||18||10||he sent Hadoram his son to king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadarezer and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had wars with Tou;) and he had with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.
1 Chronicles||18||11||These also did king David dedicate unto Jehovah, with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.
1 Chronicles||18||12||Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah smote of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt eighteen thousand.
1 Chronicles||18||13||And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became servants to David. And Jehovah gave victory to David whithersoever he went.
1 Chronicles||18||14||And David reigned over all Israel; and he executed justice and righteousness unto all his people.
1 Chronicles||18||15||And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;
1 Chronicles||18||16||and Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were priests; and Shavsha was scribe;
1 Chronicles||18||17||and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.
1 Chronicles||19||1||And it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.
1 Chronicles||19||2||And David said, I will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me. So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And Davids servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.
1 Chronicles||19||3||But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honor thy father, in that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?
1 Chronicles||19||4||So Hanun took Davids servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.
1 Chronicles||19||5||Then there went certain persons, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.
1 Chronicles||19||6||And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Arammaacah, and out of Zobah.
1 Chronicles||19||7||So they hired them thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people, who came and encamped before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.
1 Chronicles||19||8||And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.
1 Chronicles||19||9||And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the gate of the city: and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field.
1 Chronicles||19||10||Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.
1 Chronicles||19||11||And the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and they put themselves in array against the children of Ammon.
1 Chronicles||19||12||And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me; but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.
1 Chronicles||19||13||Be of good courage, and let us play the man for our people, and for the cities of our God: and Jehovah do that which seemeth him good.
1 Chronicles||19||14||So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.
1 Chronicles||19||15||And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles||19||16||And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the River, with Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer at their head.
1 Chronicles||19||17||And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.
1 Chronicles||19||18||And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians the men of seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.
1 Chronicles||19||19||And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and served him: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.
1 Chronicles||20||1||And it came to pass, at the time of the return of the year, at the time when kings go out to battle, that Joab led forth the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and overthrew it.
1 Chronicles||20||2||And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon Davids head: and he brought forth the spoil of the city, exceeding much.
1 Chronicles||20||3||And he brought forth the people that were therein, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. And thus did David unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles||20||4||And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines: then Sibbecai the Hushathite slew Sippai, of the sons of the giant; and they were subdued.
1 Chronicles||20||5||And there was again war with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weavers beam.
1 Chronicles||20||6||And there was again war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each hand, and six on each foot; and he also was born unto the giant.
1 Chronicles||20||7||And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea Davids brother slew him.
1 Chronicles||20||8||These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.
1 Chronicles||21||1||And Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel.
1 Chronicles||21||2||And David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring me word, that I may know the sum of them.
1 Chronicles||21||3||And Joab said, Jehovah make his people a hundred times as many as they are: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lords servants? why doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of guilt unto Israel?
1 Chronicles||21||4||Nevertheless the kings word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles||21||5||And Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.
1 Chronicles||21||6||But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them; for the kings word was abominable to Joab.
1 Chronicles||21||7||And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.
1 Chronicles||21||8||And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing: but now, put away, I beseech thee, the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.
1 Chronicles||21||9||And Jehovah spake unto Gad, Davids seer, saying,
1 Chronicles||21||10||Go and speak unto David, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.
1 Chronicles||21||11||So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Take which thou wilt:
1 Chronicles||21||12||either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before thy foes, while the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of Jehovah, even pestilence in the land, and the angel of Jehovah destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him that sent me.
1 Chronicles||21||13||And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall, I pray, into the hand of Jehovah; for very great are his mercies: and let me not fall into the hand of man.
1 Chronicles||21||14||So Jehovah sent a pestilence upon Israel; and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.
1 Chronicles||21||15||And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was about to destroy, Jehovah beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the destroying angel, It is enough; now stay thy hand. And the angel of Jehovah was standing by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
1 Chronicles||21||16||And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of Jehovah standing between earth and heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.
1 Chronicles||21||17||And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I pray thee, O Jehovah my God, be against me, and against my fathers house; but not against thy people, that they should be plagued.
1 Chronicles||21||18||Then the angel of Jehovah commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and rear an altar unto Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
1 Chronicles||21||19||And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of Jehovah.
1 Chronicles||21||20||And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons that were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.
1 Chronicles||21||21||And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing-floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.
1 Chronicles||21||22||Then David said to Ornan, Give me the place of this threshing-floor, that I may build thereon an altar unto Jehovah: for the full price shalt thou give it me, that the plague may be stayed from the people.
1 Chronicles||21||23||And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen for burnt-offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal-offering; I give it all.
1 Chronicles||21||24||And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for Jehovah, nor offer a burnt-offering without cost.
1 Chronicles||21||25||So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.
1 Chronicles||21||26||And David built there an altar unto Jehovah, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and called upon Jehovah; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt-offering.
1 Chronicles||21||27||And Jehovah commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.
1 Chronicles||21||28||At that time, when David saw that Jehovah had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.
1 Chronicles||21||29||For the tabernacle of Jehovah, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt-offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon.
1 Chronicles||21||30||But David could not go before it to inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of Jehovah.
1 Chronicles||22||1||Then David said, This is the house of Jehovah God, and this is the altar of burnt-offering for Israel.
1 Chronicles||22||2||And David commanded to gather together the sojourners that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God.
1 Chronicles||22||3||And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the couplings; and brass in abundance without weight;
1 Chronicles||22||4||and cedar-trees without number: for the Sidonians and they of Tyre brought cedar-trees in abundance to David.
1 Chronicles||22||5||And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be builded for Jehovah must be exceeding magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death.
1 Chronicles||22||6||Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build a house for Jehovah, the God of Israel.
1 Chronicles||22||7||And David said to Solomon his son, As for me, it was in my heart to build a house unto the name of Jehovah my God.
1 Chronicles||22||8||But the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build a house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.
1 Chronicles||22||9||Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days:
1 Chronicles||22||10||he shall build a house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.
1 Chronicles||22||11||Now, my son, Jehovah be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of Jehovah thy God, as he hath spoken concerning thee.
1 Chronicles||22||12||Only Jehovah give thee discretion and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel; that so thou mayest keep the law of Jehovah thy God.
1 Chronicles||22||13||Then shalt thou prosper, if thou observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which Jehovah charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; fear not, neither be dismayed.
1 Chronicles||22||14||Now, behold, in my affliction I have prepared for the house of Jehovah a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver, and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto.
1 Chronicles||22||15||Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all men that are skilful in every manner of work:
1 Chronicles||22||16||of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise and be doing, and Jehovah be with thee.
1 Chronicles||22||17||David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,
1 Chronicles||22||18||Is not Jehovah your God with you? and hath he not given you rest on every side? for he hath delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before Jehovah, and before his people.
1 Chronicles||22||19||Now set your heart and your soul to seek after Jehovah your God; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of Jehovah God, to bring the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of Jehovah.
1 Chronicles||23||1||Now David was old and full of days; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel.
1 Chronicles||23||2||And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.
1 Chronicles||23||3||And the Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.
1 Chronicles||23||4||Of these, twenty and four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of Jehovah; and six thousand were officers and judges;
1 Chronicles||23||5||and four thousand were doorkeepers; and four thousand praised Jehovah with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise therewith.
1 Chronicles||23||6||And David divided them into courses according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
1 Chronicles||23||7||Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.
1 Chronicles||23||8||The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, and Zetham, and Joel, three.
1 Chronicles||23||9||The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers houses of Ladan.
1 Chronicles||23||10||And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.
1 Chronicles||23||11||And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they became a fathers house in one reckoning.
1 Chronicles||23||12||The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.
1 Chronicles||23||13||The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons, for ever, to burn incense before Jehovah, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, for ever.
1 Chronicles||23||14||But as for Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi.
1 Chronicles||23||15||The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.
1 Chronicles||23||16||The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief.
1 Chronicles||23||17||And the sons of Eliezer were: Rehabiah the chief; and Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.
1 Chronicles||23||18||The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the chief.
1 Chronicles||23||19||The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
1 Chronicles||23||20||The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief, and Isshiah the second.
1 Chronicles||23||21||The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.
1 Chronicles||23||22||And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters only: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them to wife.
1 Chronicles||23||23||The sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.
1 Chronicles||23||24||These were the sons of Levi after their fathers houses, even the heads of the fathers houses of those of them that were counted, in the number of names by their polls, who did the work for the service of the house of Jehovah, from twenty years old and upward.
1 Chronicles||23||25||For David said, Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath given rest unto his people; and he dwelleth in Jerusalem for ever:
1 Chronicles||23||26||and also the Levites shall no more have need to carry the tabernacle and all the vessels of it for the service thereof.
1 Chronicles||23||27||For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were numbered, from twenty years old and upward.
1 Chronicles||23||28||For their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Jehovah, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, even the work of the service of the house of God;
1 Chronicles||23||29||for the showbread also, and for the fine flour for a meal-offering, whether of unleavened wafers, or of that which is baked in the pan, or of that which is soaked, and for all manner of measure and size;
1 Chronicles||23||30||and to stand every morning to thank and praise Jehovah, and likewise at even;
1 Chronicles||23||31||and to offer all burnt-offerings unto Jehovah, on the sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, in number according to the ordinance concerning them, continually before Jehovah;
1 Chronicles||23||32||and that they should keep the charge of the tent of meeting, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, for the service of the house of Jehovah.
1 Chronicles||24||1||And the courses of the sons of Aaron were these. The sons of Aaron: Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
1 Chronicles||24||2||But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priests office.
1 Chronicles||24||3||And David with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to their ordering in their service.
1 Chronicles||24||4||And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and thus were they divided: of the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen, heads of fathers houses; and of the sons of Ithamar, according to their fathers houses, eight.
1 Chronicles||24||5||Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for there were princes of the sanctuary, and princes of God, both of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.
1 Chronicles||24||6||And Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the scribe, who was of the Levites, wrote them in the presence of the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers houses of the priests and of the Levites; one fathers house being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.
1 Chronicles||24||7||Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,
1 Chronicles||24||8||the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,
1 Chronicles||24||9||the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,
1 Chronicles||24||10||the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,
1 Chronicles||24||11||the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah,
1 Chronicles||24||12||the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,
1 Chronicles||24||13||the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,
1 Chronicles||24||14||the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,
1 Chronicles||24||15||the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez,
1 Chronicles||24||16||the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel,
1 Chronicles||24||17||the one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to Gamul,
1 Chronicles||24||18||the three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to Maaziah.
1 Chronicles||24||19||This was the ordering of them in their service, to come into the house of Jehovah according to the ordinance given unto them by Aaron their father, as Jehovah, the God of Israel, had commanded him.
1 Chronicles||24||20||And of the rest of the sons of Levi: of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah.
1 Chronicles||24||21||Of Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah the chief.
1 Chronicles||24||22||Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath.
1 Chronicles||24||23||And the sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.
1 Chronicles||24||24||The sons of Uzziel, Micah; of the sons of Micah, Shamir.
1 Chronicles||24||25||The brother of Micah, Isshiah; of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah.
1 Chronicles||24||26||The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi; the sons of Jaaziah: Beno.
1 Chronicles||24||27||The sons of Merari: of Jaaziah, Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri.
1 Chronicles||24||28||Of Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons.
1 Chronicles||24||29||Of Kish; the sons of Kish: Jerahmeel.
1 Chronicles||24||30||And the sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites after their fathers houses.
1 Chronicles||24||31||These likewise cast lots even as their brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the heads of the fathers houses of the priests and of the Levites; the fathers houses of the chief even as those of his younger brother.
1 Chronicles||25||1||Moreover David and the captains of the host set apart for the service certain of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of them that did the work according to their service was:
1 Chronicles||25||2||of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and Asharelah, the sons of Asaph, under the hand of Asaph, who prophesied after the order of the king.
1 Chronicles||25||3||Of Jeduthun; the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hands of their father Jeduthun with the harp, who prophesied in giving thanks and praising Jehovah.

1 Chronicles||25||5||All these were the sons of Heman the kings seer in the words of God, to lift up the horn. And God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.
1 Chronicles||25||6||All these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of Jehovah, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for the service of the house of God; Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman being under the order of the king.
1 Chronicles||25||7||And the number of them, with their brethren that were instructed in singing unto Jehovah, even all that were skilful, was two hundred fourscore and eight.
1 Chronicles||25||8||And they cast lots for their offices, all alike, as well the small as the great, the teacher as the scholar.
1 Chronicles||25||9||Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to Joseph: the second to Gedaliah; he and his brethren and sons were twelve:
1 Chronicles||25||10||the third to Zaccur, his sons and his brethren, twelve:
1 Chronicles||25||11||the fourth to Izri, his sons and his brethren, twelve:
1 Chronicles||25||12||the fifth to Nethaniah, his sons and his brethren, twelve:

1 Chronicles||29||2||Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for the things of gold, and the silver for the things of silver, and the brass for the things of brass, the iron for the things of iron, and wood for the things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, stones for inlaid work, and of divers colors, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.
1 Chronicles||29||3||Moreover also, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, seeing that I have a treasure of mine own of gold and silver, I give it unto the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,
1 Chronicles||29||4||even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, wherewith to overlay the walls of the houses;
1 Chronicles||29||5||of gold for the things of gold, and of silver for the things of silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers. Who then offereth willingly to consecrate himself this day unto Jehovah?
1 Chronicles||29||6||Then the princes of the fathers houses, and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the kings work, offered willingly;
1 Chronicles||29||7||and they gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and of iron a hundred thousand talents.
1 Chronicles||29||8||And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of Jehovah, under the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.
1 Chronicles||29||9||Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to Jehovah: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.
1 Chronicles||29||10||Wherefore David blessed Jehovah before all the assembly; and David said, Blessed be thou, O Jehovah, the God of Israel our father, for ever and ever.
1 Chronicles||29||11||Thine, O Jehovah, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O Jehovah, and thou art exalted as head above all.
1 Chronicles||29||12||Both riches and honor come of thee, and thou rulest over all; and in thy hand is power and might; and in thy hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.
1 Chronicles||29||13||Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.
1 Chronicles||29||14||But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.
1 Chronicles||29||15||For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as all our fathers were: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no abiding.
1 Chronicles||29||16||O Jehovah our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee a house for thy holy name cometh of thy hand, and is all thine own.
1 Chronicles||29||17||I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, that are present here, offer willingly unto thee.
1 Chronicles||29||18||O Jehovah, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee;
1 Chronicles||29||19||and give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for which I have made provision.
1 Chronicles||29||20||And David said to all the assembly, Now bless Jehovah your God. And all the assembly blessed Jehovah, the God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped Jehovah, and the king.
1 Chronicles||29||21||And they sacrificed sacrifices unto Jehovah, and offered burnt-offerings unto Jehovah, on the morrow after that day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink-offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel,
1 Chronicles||29||22||and did eat and drink before Jehovah on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him unto Jehovah to be prince, and Zadok to be priest.
1 Chronicles||29||23||Then Solomon sat on the throne of Jehovah as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.
1 Chronicles||29||24||And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.

1 Chronicles||29||27||And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.
1 Chronicles||29||28||And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.
1 Chronicles||29||29||Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer,
1 Chronicles||29||30||with all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.
