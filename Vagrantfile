  # Private Network (default)
  #
  # A private network is created by default. This is the IP address through which your
  # host machine will communicate to the guest. In this default configuration, the virtual
  # machine will have an IP address of 192.168.50.4 and a virtual network adapter will be
  # created on your host machine with the IP of 192.168.50.1 as a gateway.
  #
  # Access to the guest machine is only available to your local host. To provide access to
  # other devices, a public network should be configured or port forwarding enabled.
  #
  # Note: If your existing network is using the 192.168.50.x subnet, this default IP address
  # should be changed. If more than one VM is running through VirtualBox, including other
  # Vagrant machines, different subnets should be used for each.
